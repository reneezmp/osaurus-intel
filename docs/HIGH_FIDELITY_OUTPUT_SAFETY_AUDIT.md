# High-Fidelity Output Safety Audit

This audit records the current write path for generated files after the input
fidelity lanes moved workbook reading into core `file_read`.

## Current Write Path

`file_write` remains a UTF-8 text/code tool. It can return a dry-run diff and
risk warnings before applying, creates parent directories when explicitly
applied, writes atomically, and refuses structured package targets (`.xlsx`,
`.pdf`, `.pptx` families) so an agent cannot create invalid office/PDF output by
writing plain text with a package extension. For tabular text output, agents
should write CSV/TSV.

Structured workbook output stays on the document-emitter/plugin path.
`XLSXEmitter` assembles an OOXML ZIP package in memory, validates workbook
bounds before writing, rejects formulas instead of flattening them, rejects
workbooks with no renderable cells, rejects overlong cell text and invalid XML,
and only then writes the package atomically.

PDF/PPTX creation remains diagnostic-only in core. `PDFPPTXWorkflowService`
reports whether a structured emitter is registered for a typed PDF/PPTX
document; on current main it returns `missingEmitter`, keeping fake binary
packages off the text-only `file_write` path.

Tool exposure stays narrow. Folder plugin hints only bias installed spreadsheet
plugins, preflight injection respects installed plugin ids and per-agent
allowlists, and default-agent `capabilities_load` cannot load plugin tools.
No workbook writer is added to the default schema.

## Coverage Matrix

| Surface | Safety contract | Proof |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `file_write` | Text-only writes; rejects `.xlsx`, `.pdf`, and `.pptx`-family targets before logging or touching the existing file | `FolderToolsResilienceTests.fileWrite_rejectsWorkbookPackagesWithoutTouchingExistingFile`, `FolderToolsResilienceTests.fileWrite_rejectsPDFAndPresentationPackagesWithoutTouchingExistingFile` |
| Dry-run write/edit | `dry_run: true` returns a bounded diff/risk preview, does not mutate files, and does not log fake operations | `FolderToolsResilienceTests.fileWrite_dryRunPreviewsDiffWithoutWritingOrLogging`, `FolderToolsResilienceTests.fileEdit_dryRunPreviewsDiffWithoutMutatingOrLogging` |
| Operation history | Applied file writes/edits are visible through a session-scoped history tool | `FolderToolsResilienceTests.fileWrite_applyLogsInspectableOperationHistory` |
| CSV output | Text tabular output remains allowed through `file_write` | `FolderToolsResilienceTests.fileWrite_allowsCSVTextOutput` |
| XLSX emitter | Valid scalar workbooks round-trip through the XLSX adapter | `XLSXEmitterTests.emit_roundTripsScalarWorkbookThroughXLSXAdapter` |
| XLSX formula safety | Formula cells are rejected, while formula-looking strings stay inert shared strings | `XLSXEmitterTests.emit_rejectsFormulaCellsWithoutFlatteningThem`, `XLSXEmitterTests.emit_keepsFormulaLookingTextInert` |
| XLSX bounds | Empty exports, whitespace-only exports, overlong cell text, invalid names/references, non-finite numbers, and ZIP32 overflows are rejected before package write | `XLSXEmitterTests`, `XLSXAdapterTests` |
| PDF/PPTX creation diagnostics | Typed PDF/PPTX workflows report registered emitters or `missingEmitter` and do not route creation through text writes | `PDFPPTXWorkflowServiceTests` |
| Tool exposure | XLSX plugin injection is bias-only, installed-plugin gated, and allowlist-respecting | `PreflightCapabilitySearchTests.folderInjection_*`, `FolderPluginHintsTests` |

## Follow-Up Lanes

1. Add first-party workbook write UI/tooling only when it can call the
   structured emitter directly and surface save/share state as an artifact.
2. Keep extending structured creation only through real emitters, artifact
   surfacing, and validation errors; do not add package-shaped text writes.
3. Keep sandbox write parity separate: `sandbox_write_file` has a different
   filesystem boundary and should be audited in its own lane before changing
   behavior.
