# Deferred-commit feasibility audit — 2026-09-08

> This is a commit-feasibility audit, not a feature-parity report. Apply the
> states and mandatory review workflow in [`FEATURE_PARITY.md`](FEATURE_PARITY.md)
> before describing any upstream range as complete. A feasible commit remains
> unimplemented until its user-visible behavior is recorded as working and
> tested there.

## Correction

The earlier ledgers used **DEFER** for several different judgments: hardware-incompatible, irrelevant to the Intel product, mixed with excluded code, large, or simply difficult. That blurred feasibility with effort. This audit supersedes every DEFER verdict in the 0.24.3 and 0.24.7 ledgers.

Of the 73 deferred commits, **58 are technically feasible Intel work**: 1 is now landed, 28 have a useful slice ready for direct porting, and 29 belong on an explicit dependency-ordered roadmap. The remaining 15 are skips because they only serve the removed MLX/local-model runtime, replace an intentionally different Intel subsystem, or add eval-only machinery rather than app behavior.

The live ledgers now show 72 DEFER rows because `eca456c3` was corrected to PORT in the same commit. The 73 count above refers to the pre-correction ledgers: 61 in the 0.24.3 ledger plus 12 in the later ledger.

“Touches excluded files” is no longer a blocker by itself. A future verdict must identify the incompatible behavior, or classify the commit as a hand port / roadmap item. Size and conflict are effort estimates.

## Execution order

1. Finish and validate the Claude Code CLI slice (`eca456c3`).
2. Re-review the 28 **PORT NEXT** commits by live Intel file overlap; extract narrow patches and tests rather than replaying whole commits.
3. **Completed 2026-09-08:** project working folders and Knowledge now ship together with the full project page; folder roots are per-chat and also drive Claude Code's working directory.
4. Revisit shell/history, delegation/orchestrator, channels, and onboarding as explicit product milestones.

The **SKIP** label means “no useful behavior in this fork,” not “too hard.” If the Intel product later adopts that subsystem, its commits return to the roadmap.
