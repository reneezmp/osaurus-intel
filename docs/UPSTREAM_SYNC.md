## Pending next sync: 0.20.3 → 0.24.3 (triaged 2026-09-02, Session 11)

**Range:** `9124d696..4528b56f` — **783 commits**, upstream `0.20.3` → `0.24.3` (+17 untagged).
**Status: Waves A–E are ported and committed on `sync/0.24.3` / `intel-fork`; nothing is released
yet.** See *Sync execution log* at the end of this section. The triage below is what the work was
planned from; the staged execution plan lives in
[`SYNC_0.24.3_PLAN.md`](SYNC_0.24.3_PLAN.md), and the full per-commit verdict table (all 476
reviewed commits) is in [`UPSTREAM_TRIAGE_0.24.3.md`](UPSTREAM_TRIAGE_0.24.3.md).

**Shape of the work (decided 2026-09-02): three releases.**

| Release | Contents |
|---|---|
| `1.0.32` Stabilize | keychain + Router hotfixes, then the Sentry crash/hang set |
| `1.0.33` Modernize | fast-forward the 52 PORT-touched pristine files, then proxy + MCP |
| `1.0.34` **Projects** | `8a9d32ea` rebuilt against the Intel mirrors, then the rest of chat QoL |

Backlogged: `311d9095` (storage encryption — gated on root-causing Rosy's `hmac` decrypt error)
and the 61-commit deferred shelf (re-triage after 1.0.34).

### How this triage was produced

A deterministic classifier (not judgment) first eliminated **307 of 783** by parsing the
164-path `exclude:` list straight out of `Packages/OsaurusCore/Package.swift` and intersecting
it with each commit's touched files:

| Auto-bucket | Count | Rule |
|---|---:|---|
| IGNORE | 92 | docs / `.github` / appcast / `.xcstrings` / evals only |
| NEW-SUBSYSTEM | 90 | touches **only files absent from the fork** — brand-new upstream subsystems |
| INFRA-ONLY | 76 | only `Package.resolved` / `Package.swift` / xcworkspace — vmlx repin churn |
| SKIP | 49 | every touched file is on the `exclude:` list |
| **REVIEW** | **476** | touches ≥1 file the Intel target actually compiles |

The 476 survivors were then split into 5 chronological windows and judged individually.

### Verdict totals (476 reviewed)

| Verdict | Count |
|---|---:|
| ✅ PORT | **211** |
| ⛔️ SKIP | 204 |
| ⏸️ DEFER | 61 |

| Window | Upstream range | Tags | PORT | SKIP | DEFER |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| W1 | `b8ef10aa..3bee1703` | 0.20.3 → 0.21.0 | 52 | 32 | 12 |
| W2 | `f09b2123..a15efa73` | 0.21.0 → 0.21.13 | 40 | 45 | 11 |
| W3 | `93e6394e..5bb946f7` | 0.21.13 → 0.22.9 | 26 | 61 | 9 |
| W4 | `d417cdf9..c4d9d140` | 0.22.9 → 0.22.20 | 57 | 29 | 10 |
| W5 | `4e2bcb03..e03127e7` | 0.22.20 → 0.24.3 | 36 | 37 | 19 |

> ⚠️ **Confidence caveat.** The per-commit verdicts are a **first-pass triage by small models**,
> not a review. They are a map of where to dig, not an authorization to cherry-pick. Verify each
> commit against fork reality before it lands. Known first-pass errors already corrected:
> Product Hunt marketing dialogs (`f8b1c02e`, `67eeaf0b`) were mislabelled PORT; the
> swap-pressure banner series (`a9d2a150`, `29fedb38`, `1b58dcf9`) warns about *local model*
> RAM pressure and is meaningless on a cloud-only fork.

### Why 783 collapses to 211

Upstream spent this era building an **agent-orchestration platform**: Orchestrator + delegation,
Agent Channels (Telegram/iMessage), subagent batching, Computer Use + AppleScript, Skills,
Knowledge base, Browser Use, image/video generation, and a community model-compat leaderboard.
The fork amputates every one of those. This is not drift — it is a divergence of *purpose*.
Upstream went agentic-multiplayer; the Intel fork is sovereign cloud inference on old metal.

### The five PORT clusters

1. **Cloud provider & Router hardening** — the fork's lifeline.
   `5f12d260` (remote-provider crashes/hangs, endpoint trust, **Router spend safety**, streaming) ·
   `563f9174` (Router 409 idempotency on refunded iterations) · `6ecd2133` (credits UI dollars→credits) ·
   `89ccb249` + `757807f9` (redeemable credit codes) · `0a8c5008` (providers stuck disconnected after
   relaunch) · `577a3eee` (honor custom-provider context windows) · `4137884f` (media rejection recovery
   + OpenAI hardening) · `f9478c0f` (lenient decode for nonstandard streaming chunks during tool calls) ·
   `f01e5d44` (xAI OAuth stale catalog) · `bbad6ed9` (Fireworks only showing 6 models)
2. **Keychain & identity** — `984debe2` (harden keychain on relaunch + identity restore from recovery
   phrase) · `e06996e3` (specific keychain errors, recover ACL-denied credential saves). Directly on top
   of the fork's stable-signing-identity scar tissue.
3. **Crashes & main-thread hangs** — Sentry-triaged, generic AppKit/SwiftUI: `03ea4c93`, `c8be96cc`,
   `99537680`, `6daf54cb`, `dfd412f6`, `0d07b052` (notch display-reconfig + TextKit), `3ba84c38`,
   `2eac8d32`, `286c4a9a`, `cc6732d7`, `161e6ca5`.
4. **Chat QoL** — full-text search + ⌘F (`5ada76dc`) · Projects/chat grouping (`8a9d32ea`) · pinned chats
   (`6ae20356`) · multi-select delete/archive (`479133ba`) · auto chat titles (`5bb946f7`) + `/title`
   (`3580502c`) · import from ChatGPT/Claude/Grok (`311f327c`, `48c6d197`) · delete individual messages
   (`c4d9d140`) · ⌘N (`e0eeba12`) · ⌘± zoom (`1b955c2b`) · resizable sidebar (`035ed272`) · inline +
   display LaTeX (`f3608d88`, `8a8f01ec`) · escape-eats-your-prompt fix (`08eb8bd8`) · LLM context
   compaction (`ce414b3f`) · `96b05d20` (hide local-memory warnings for cloud models).
5. **Storage, proxy, MCP** — `311d9095` (storage encryption opt-in, 50 files — SQLCipher, handle with
   tongs) · `9ddb49b0` (migration hardening) · `304ad2bb` + `0ba6a01a` + `52d4aa9b` (global proxy) ·
   `774aa836` (MCP session recovery + OAuth single-flight) · `3f4791e7` (paginated tool discovery) ·
   `12ff17c7` (bearer 401 classification) · `f5009855` (MCP URL detection in provider form).

### Blanket SKIP (do not revisit)

Orchestrator / delegation (`8d7c3dd4` alone is a 195-file refactor), Agent Channels + Telegram +
iMessage, Computer Use + AppleScript, Skills, Browser Use, image/video generation,
every MTP / speculative-decoding / vMLX repin, the entire evals harness + community leaderboard,
Sandbox, and upstream's own marketing modals (Product Hunt, "what's new" for amputated features).

> **Not blanket-SKIP: the Knowledge base.** It was previously written off as permanently
> amputated because it needs embeddings. That is obsolete — the fork's pure-Swift model2vec
> `potion-base-8M` static embedder already runs acceptably on Rosy (it powers local semantic
> memory). Knowledge is therefore **viable on Intel and wanted**, just not in this sync. See
> the backlog in [`SYNC_0.24.3_PLAN.md`](SYNC_0.24.3_PLAN.md) §10.

### Sync execution log (2026-09-02/03)

| Commit | Wave | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `9ca6c90f` | A — keychain / Router / provider | 7 candidates → 4 partial ports, 3 dissolved to SKIP |
| `56e3a422..0680502c` | B — crashes & hangs | 11 candidates → 8 hand-ported, 3 SKIP |
| `1c84bf11` | build | `swift-secp256k1` → 0.23.2 (Swift 6.4; see the pin note above) |
| `52cf68ce` | C — pristine fast-forward | 50 selected → 33 landed, 17 reverted as coupled |
| `7b816ca5` | E′ — proxy & MCP | 8 candidates → 5 ported/partial, 3 SKIP |
| `c53a84f0` | D₀ — **Projects** + math | rebuilt against Intel mirrors; knowledge dimension dropped |
| `b1c68b3b` | D₁a — search, pinned chats, multi-select | salvaged after a rate-limit interruption |
| `2d6ee24d` | D₁b — titles, import, delete, resize, shortcuts | 9 ported, 1 declined, 1 SKIP |

**Two numbers worth carrying into the next sync:** **zero** upstream commits applied as a clean
cherry-pick — every single one needed hand-porting or reverting. And **~31%** of first-pass PORT
verdicts dissolved once checked against what the fork actually compiles. Budget for verification,
not transcription.

**Not ported, deliberately:** `ce414b3f` (LLM context compaction — ~3800 lines tied to local
warm-up and KV-cache machinery this fork lacks) and `96b05d20` (hides local RAM/swap warnings that
do not exist here). Both belong to the backlog, not to a future retry-as-is.

## Sync 0.20.3 → `9124d696` — global-proxy batch (2026-06-17, Session 10)

12 commits in `7901ec42..9124d696`, all the upstream "Route X through global proxy" series
(threading network calls through `GlobalProxySettings`) plus a couple of fixes. **Ported (4):**

| Upstream | Intel action |
|---|---|
| `23aaa5cc` | router API → global proxy — our `OsaurusRouterAPIClient` (uses `makeSession(base:)` verbatim) |
| `572273a8` | theme API → global proxy — `ThemesAPIClient` (`makeSession(base:)` verbatim) |
| `62755e65` | markdown image downloads → proxy — `MarkdownImageView` + `NativeMarkdownView`; mapped upstream's `sharedSession()` → our `makeSession()` |
| `17f27b4f` | sandbox-plugin manifest fetch → proxy — `SandboxPlugin.fromURL`; `sharedSession()` → `makeSession()` |

> **Proxy-API note:** Intel's `GlobalProxySettings` exposes only `makeSession()` (fresh per
> call), not upstream's cached `sharedSession()`/`currentProxyCacheKey()`. Every upstream
> `sharedSession()` consumer maps to `makeSession()` — functionally equivalent (always honors the
> current proxy), just uncached. Do NOT port `currentProxyCacheKey()`; it only serves the caching design we don't use.

**SKIP (excluded/absent/divergent):** `07ba93e1` (MCP OAuth → proxy — our MCP OAuth is divergent;
`MCPOAuthHTTPTransport`/`noRedirectSession` absent, no valid target), `6e47dfe9` (`SandboxManager`
excluded), `7dc814bf` (`RelayTunnelManager` excluded), `5621ef11` (`RemoteAgentManager` excluded),
`217c8c7d` (`PrivacyFilterModelDownloader` absent — model-download subsystem), `8247f63a`
(`GitHubSkillService` excluded), `9124d696` (`ShareArtifactTool` excluded).
**DEFER:** `395fe51e` (allow manual provider models during connection tests — needs a `manualModelIds:`
param threaded through the excluded/mirrored `IntelStubConformers.testConnection` for a niche
Azure-deployment onboarding flow; ~zero value for Intel's cloud-DeepSeek path).

## Sync 0.20.0 → 0.20.3 (2026-06-14, Session 9)

21 commits in `24924e6f..7901ec42`. **Ported (7):**

| Upstream | Intel action |
|---|---|
| `8dd49a65` | Codex OAuth diagnostic context (`ProviderNetworkDiagnostics`) |
| `4569b76f` | OAuth → global proxy — adapted `GlobalProxySettings.sharedSession()` (unported) → `makeSession()` |
| `13bb8b47` | configurable Hugging Face cache path (down-leveled the new `onChange`) |
| `ef180dd8` | local access-key lifecycle — `AccessKeyLifecycleService`; ServerView adapted (`ServerController` excluded → server is loopback-only) |
| `7901ec42` | **partial** — ChatView static `ISO8601DateFormatter` cache (main-thread alloc); `PluginRepositoryService` part skipped (excluded) |
| `6c18cb91` | **partial** — `ToolConfigurationStore` only; the ToolsManagerView tools-section hang fix needs the **unported `37a2291b` `ToolAvailability`** + a card refactor that would lose the M16 blank-gap fix |
| `bd0e196d`+`54d650ba` | `Localizable.xcstrings` full-file from upstream |

**SKIP (excluded/divergent):** `b768bbcb` (RemoteProviderService — Intel uses CloudChatEngine),
`9e390950` (PluginHostAPI), `33c41661`/`8ff06de3` (host stdio MCP → excluded `SandboxStdioRunner`),
`dee498b8` (ToolIndexService/CapabilityTools), `e5419a3b` (MLX kv-cache), `5b3c2fa6` (paste-URL — a
*fix* to a feature Intel's divergent `RemoteProviderEditSheet` never had). **DEFER:** `e8bcba8a`
(onboarding model-selection — mixed with excluded RemoteProviderManager/ToolIndexService).
**IGNORE:** 3 appcasts, `44bc8ae6` (whats-new), `ae34ca6a` (legacy storage marker).

> **Versioning note:** the fork keeps its **own** version line (`1.0.x`) — we do
> NOT peg it to upstream's number (the fork amputates whole subsystems, so a
> pegged number would imply false parity). The upstream correspondence is shown
> as *metadata* in the About panel + release notes, sourced from a single
> constant: `IntelBuildInfo.upstreamBase` / `upstreamCommit`. Keep that constant
> in lockstep with the two values above.

## Sync 0.19.15 → 0.20.0 (2026-06-14, Session 6)

95 commits in `d132b728..24924e6f`. The exclude-list amputates MLX/memory/skills/
slash-registry/sandbox/p2p, so most were SKIP. **Ported (15 substantive):**

| Area | Upstream | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| tok/s accuracy | `26573b24` | new `RollingTokenRate` (shared) |
| image context tokens | `0da56927` | `Attachment` resolution-based estimate |
| theme button colors | `0c5b4bf0` | `ThemeEditorView` |
| raw JSON theme editor | `15df6096` | new `ThemeJSONEditorCodec` + editor; resolved union with the bg-decode hang fix |
| theme-editor + watcher hang | `76a07e24` | bg image decode off-main (`decodeThemeBackgroundImage`) |
| fatal crashes | `62191278` | only `ModelMediaCapabilities` applies — PrivacyFilter is DU (Intel lacks it); `osaurusApp` kept ours |
| quit/plugin-teardown crash | `0168ff40` | `ExternalPlugin`/`DebugLog`; `AppDelegate` kept ours (excluded teardown deps), `TelemetryService` DU |
| ClipboardService main-thread hang | `f1b069de` `374e3190` `1bb474c1` | pasteboard XPC moved off-main (recurring fix; `ModelDetailView`/`ManagementBadgeStore` kept ours) |
| tool-envelope hang | `69753ad8` | `ToolEnvelope` shared; `ToolRegistry` excluded (took theirs, dead code) |
| chat-jump-on-completion | `2c4d6089` | **merged** into our Intel `handlePostSnapshotScroll` — kept our `isNewTurn`/`wasPinnedToBottom` structure, added the `isStreaming` gate |
| sidebar rename | `24a5e3e9` | sidebar UI auto-merged; the view-model sync (`session.title`/`archived`) hand-ported into Intel `ChatContentView` callbacks (chat layout is extracted on Intel) |
| visual/interaction polish | `3a4edaae` | theme polish (CustomTheme/Theme/AgentInlineBlocks) only; `FloatingInputCard` budget-tint kept ours (needs excluded `ContextBudgetManager`), `ShimmerLabel` DU dropped |
| localization | `392954aa` … `e6894ce5` | full-file `Localizable.xcstrings` from upstream (both Intel strings present) |

**SKIP (bulk):** all vMLX pins + Gemma/DiffusionGemma/MLX runtime + memory/episodes +
skills/slash-registry + WindowManager/ModelManager hang fixes (excluded) + appcasts/CI.

**DEFER (revisit in a focused session):**
- `58aab452` **hosted inference** (0.20.0 marquee) — `ContentBlock`/`ChatTurn`/`OpenAIAPI`/
  `RemoteProviderManager` mirrored/excluded; conflicts with `CloudChatEngine`.
- `a39b2d89` **p2p e2e encryption** — isolated `Identity/*` pairing; not exposed on Intel.
- `7068b131` **sandbox-by-default** — `BuiltinSandboxTools`/`SandboxToolRegistrar` excluded.
- `2a58c239` + `ae4541d4` **model-picker UX** — Intel's `ModelPickerView` diverged
  (`cachedGroupedOptions`/`groupedBySource()` vs upstream's `rebuildTabs()` tabs); reconcile later.
- `c2231910` slash command (excluded registry), `4a9a23f0` system prompts (excluded composer),
  `37a2291b`/`be43da1a` tool/MCP diagnostics (excluded deps), `3a743373` external-model-mgmt
  (Intel-kept `ModelDetailView`/`AppDelegate`), `e6b78e36` onboarding polish, `fc1626c6` whats-new.

### Deferred-shelf deep dive (2026-06-14, Session 7)

Re-examined the deferral list for faithful portability. Outcome:

**✅ Ported faithfully:**
- `c2231910` **`/agent` slash command** — `SlashCommand` + picker UI (`SharedHeaderComponents`)
  applied verbatim; `chatToolbarOpenAgentPicker` was added only to `ChatWindowManager`'s
  `#if !OSAURUS_INTEL` branch, so it was **mirrored into `IntelDataConformers`** and the listener
  bridged into the Intel `IntelToolbarAgentView` (`openPickerTrigger` + `.onReceive`) so the command
  actually opens the picker. (3× two-param `onChange` down-leveled for Ventura.)
- `3a743373` **prune-deleted external models** — `ExternalModelLocator` +`pruneMissing()` call in
  `ModelPickerView`. The reveal-in-Finder **UI** lives in the divergent `ModelDetailView` → kept ours.

**🧱 Architecturally incompatible (NOT faithfully portable — rooted in amputated subsystems):**
- `a39b2d89` **p2p e2e** — crypto is self-contained but its transport (`BonjourBrowser`/
  `RelayTunnelManager`) is excluded; encrypting a channel Intel never opens = dead code. *(still blocked)*
- `be43da1a` **local MCP probe** — `MCPProviderProbeService` hard-needs excluded `SandboxStdioRunner`. *(still blocked)*

**🔧 Ported as Intel glue (Session 8, 2026-06-14 — `dfcc19cc`):**
- `58aab452` **hosted inference / "Osaurus Router"** — initially called incompatible, but
  `CloudChatEngine` already routes to any OpenAI-compatible provider via the stubbed
  `RemoteProviderManager`, so it WAS doable as a glue port. The "wallet" is the user's
  existing Osaurus identity (EIP-191 `deriveOsaurusId`→EVM address), not a separate wallet.
  Added `.osaurusRouter` provider type, the self-contained Router/credits files, a managed
  provider registration + signed catalog fetch in the stub, request signing in
  `CloudChatEngine` (stream+complete), and a `ManagementTab.credits` entry. Dropped the
  redundant `OpenAICompatibleStreamParser` (CloudChatEngine streams natively) and decoupled
  `StorageMutationGate`/`FeatureTelemetry`/insights cross-refs. **Compiles app-wide; live use
  needs a funded router account (untested).** Composer credits-chip deferred.
- `a39b2d89` **p2p e2e** — crypto is self-contained but its transport (`BonjourBrowser`/
  `RelayTunnelManager`) is excluded; encrypting a channel Intel never opens = dead code.
- `be43da1a` **local MCP probe** — `MCPProviderProbeService` hard-needs excluded `SandboxStdioRunner`.

**⏭ Skipped / needs-rewrite:** `2a58c239`+`ae4541d4` model-picker (Intel's grouping model would need
re-architecting to upstream's tabs — not a faithful diff), `7068b131` sandbox-default (enforcement in
excluded `BuiltinSandboxTools`), `fc1626c6` whats-new (keyed on excluded sandbox/pairing), `e6b78e36`
onboarding polish (low value).

## Sync workflow (monthly)

```bash
git fetch upstream
# Only NEW commits since last sync — never reparse old ones
git log d132b728..upstream/main --oneline
# Classify → PORT/SKIP/MIRROR → cherry-pick/ignore → update this ledger
# When done:
#   1. update the "Last synced upstream commit" hash + "Upstream version era" above
#   2. update IntelBuildInfo.swift (upstreamBase + upstreamCommit) to match
#      — that constant feeds the About panel and the release-notes footer.
```  

---

## Triage Rubric

```
For each upstream commit:
  git show --stat <commit>

  IF all files in Package.resolved + Package.swift
    → SKIP "vMLX version pin"

  IF all files in exclude: list AND no Intel mirror exists
    → SKIP "amputated subsystem"

  IF all files in test directories
    → IGNORE "test-only"

  IF any file in exclude: list WITH an Intel conformer mirror
    → MIRROR "re-implement in <conformer file>"

  IF all files in shared (non-excluded, non-test) code
    → PORT — cherry-pick

  IF mixed (some shared, some excluded)
    → EVALUATE — port shared subset, skip excluded
```

## Perpetual Conflict Files (always `--ours`)

- `Package.swift` — different dependencies, exclude list, OSAURUS_INTEL flag
- `Package.resolved` — different dependency graph

> **Deliberate pin divergence (2026-09-02): `swift-secp256k1` is `exact: "0.23.2"` here,
> while upstream stays on `exact: "0.21.1"`.** 0.21.1 does not compile under Swift 6.4:
> `UInt256` declares both `SIMDWordsInteger` and `UnsignedInteger`, both of which require
> `words`, and the newer compiler rejects `for word in words` as ambiguous
> (`P256K/UInt256.swift:215`) — even though the package already declares
> `swiftLanguageModes: [.v5]`. This breaks **every** commit including untouched baselines, in
> both architectures, so it is not sync damage. Upstream has not hit it because they are not on
> 6.4 yet. 0.23.2 builds clean with no source changes on our side. When upstream eventually
> bumps their pin, drop this divergence and follow them.
>
> **Knock-on effect — build-tool plugin validation.** 0.23.2 ships a
> `SharedSourcesPlugin` build-tool plugin that 0.21.1 did not. Xcode refuses to run an
> unvalidated package plugin from the command line, so `xcodebuild` dies at
> *"Validate plug-in SharedSourcesPlugin"* **before compiling a single file**, while
> `swift build` is unaffected — which makes it invisible to the usual Ventura build check.
> `scripts/build/build_rosy.sh` (the release path, called from `cut_intel_release.sh`) and
> `scripts/build/build_arm64.sh` therefore pass `-skipPackagePluginValidation
> -skipMacroValidation`. Without them the release ceremony fails with three lines of output
> and no obvious cause. Remove these flags if the secp256k1 pin is ever reverted.
- `RuntimePolicySourceTests.swift` — vMLX source-policy tests

### Intel-Specific Fixups (commit `8f86d6d5`)

| Fix | Reason |
|---|---|
| RemoteProviderEditSheet.swift reverted to Intel version | Upstream file depends on unported types (ProviderTextField, ProviderSecureField, OpenAICodexOAuthService, disableTimeout) |
| Package.swift: exclude RemoteReasoningPolicy.swift | Depends on excluded ThinkingConfig / RemoteProviderService |
| Stripped `public` from OAuthSignInCoordinator + ProviderCredentialInstructions | Intel module is internal; upstream uses library visibility |
| Re-added `#if !OSAURUS_INTEL` guards to 5 onboarding files | Lost during `--theirs` conflict resolution |
| Removed duplicate ProviderInputFields.swift | Intel defines ProviderTextField/ProviderSecureField inline in RemoteProviderEditSheet |

## Stats

- **Total upstream commits processed:** 44 substantive + ~97 vMLX pins + ~38 xcstrings
- **Sessions:** 5 (2026-06-07/2026-06-08) | **Fully caught up to upstream/main** ✅

---

## Deferred / watch-list

- **Chat "bubble" rendering for thoughts + tool-calls.** The Apple-Silicon
  Osaurus renders reasoning/tool-call blocks in a newer "bubble" style; Intel
  renders the 0.19.15 "card" style. The `Native*` chat views
  (`NativeThinkingView`, `NativeToolCallGroupView`, `NativeMessageCellView`,
  `NativeBlockViews` — ~5.3k lines of hand-tuned AppKit) are SHARED, not
  Intel-divergent, so this is **not** an Intel reimplementation — it's a newer
  upstream redesign. It is NOT in the 41 commits after `d132b728` (by subject).
  **Decision (Renée, 2026-06-11): do NOT reinvent it.** If a future upstream
  sync brings the redesign as a real commit, port it then. Otherwise leave the
  card style as-is.

## ⚠️ Intel-owned files & post-sync verification (GUARDRAIL)

The `9b79161b` / App-Intents syncs silently **reverted** Intel customizations by
taking "theirs" on cherry-picks (found + fixed in 1.0.15): the README was
replaced with upstream's, and `RemoteProviderKeychain` lost its Intel isolation.
These compile fine reverted, so they slip through. **After EVERY sync, verify
these Intel-owned customizations survived:**

| File | Must contain (Intel) | Not (upstream) |
|---|---|---|
| `README.md` | `🦕 Osaurus (Intel)` header, "Run a model locally" | `Own your AI`, `brew install --cask osaurus` |
| `Packages/OsaurusCore/Services/Provider/RemoteProviderKeychain.swift` | `ai.osaurus.remote.intel` (`#if OSAURUS_INTEL`) | bare `ai.osaurus.remote` only |
| `Packages/OsaurusCore/Services/MCP/MCPProviderKeychain.swift` | `ai.osaurus.mcp.intel` | bare `ai.osaurus.mcp` only |
| `App/osaurus/Info.plist` | `SUFeedURL` → `reneezmp/osaurus-intel`, `SUPublicEDKey` `7Nh8jSxF…` | `osaurus-ai` / missing |
| `scripts/release/cut_intel_release.sh` | `REPO="reneezmp/osaurus-intel"` | upstream repo |
| `scripts/build/build_rosy.sh` | bakes `OsaurusCanonicalData` | — |
| `Packages/OsaurusCore/Identity/MasterKey.swift` (DO NOT isolate) | `com.osaurus.account`, synchronizable — **shared identity, leave as-is** | a `.intel` variant (would fracture identity) |

**Revert-detector** (run after each sync — lists Swift files that lost ALL their
Intel guards vs the last known-good tag):

```bash
comm -23 \
  <(git grep -l OSAURUS_INTEL <good-tag> -- '*.swift' | sed 's/^[^:]*://' | sort -u) \
  <(git grep -l OSAURUS_INTEL HEAD       -- '*.swift' | sed 's/^[^:]*://' | sort -u)
```

**Rule:** the README, the two provider/MCP keychain service names, the updater
config (Info.plist), and the release/build scripts are Intel-owned — on a
cherry-pick conflict, ALWAYS keep ours. The Master Key (`com.osaurus.account`)
is the opposite: shared + iCloud-synced identity, never give it an Intel variant.

## ⚠️ Ventura (macOS 13) backport maintenance (Phase B, 2026-06-12)

The deployment target is **macOS 13**, enforced by the compiler. After every
upstream sync, the build will fail on any new API that requires 14+. Recurring
categories to watch for:

| Pattern | Fix |
|---|---|
| `@Observable` macro | Convert to `ObservableObject` + `@Published` |
| `.onChange(of:){ _, v in }` | Down-level to `{ v in }` (bulk Perl regex available) |
| `.onChange(of:){ named, v in }` | Manual: `@State` prev-value var |
| `.symbolEffect` | Remove or `.contentTransition(.opacity)` |
| `.activateAllWindows` | Use `.activateIgnoringOtherApps` |
| new 14+ decorative APIs | Plain 13-compatible replacement (no `#available` gates) |

**Post-sync Ventura build check:**
```bash
cd Packages/OsaurusCore && swift build --arch x86_64
```
Fix every "only available in macOS 14/15" error, rebuild, repeat until clean.
