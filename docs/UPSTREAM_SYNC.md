**Base commit:** `d0782cbb` (Pin vMLX main runtime and harden server boundaries, #1201)  
**Intel fork:** `github.com/reneezmp/osaurus-intel` (`intel-fork`)  
**Upstream:** `github.com/osaurus-ai/osaurus` (`main`)  
**Last synced upstream commit:** `7e109ade` (cold-load retry ownership, #2668)
**Upstream version era:** `0.24.7` (`0.24.7-24-g7e109ade`)
**Last sync date:** 2026-09-07
**Commit-coverage status:** 🟢 **Classified through `7e109ade`**. This does not claim feature parity. All 53 commits after the 0.24.3 checkpoint received a verdict; applicable Intel slices were hand-ported, while the feature ledger records what is still partial, dependency-blocked, absent, or intentionally omitted. Intel releases: 1.0.20 (cache + Ventura layout), 1.0.21 (0.19.15→0.20.0 absorb), 1.0.22 (deferred shelf), 1.0.23 (0.20.0→0.20.3 sync), 1.0.24 (global proxy batch), … 1.0.34 (Projects).

## Test-storage isolation incident (2026-09-10)

Agent Settings runtime tests initially saved the global chat configuration while
other suites changed the process-wide storage root. Cross-suite concurrency let
cleanup write a sparse fixture into the live chat configuration and leave one
test agent behind. The live model and tool-attempt fields were recovered from
the preceding application log, the test agent was inspected and removed, and
the affected tests were changed to use disposable agents and the shared storage
lock.

The definitive validation used explicit `--no-parallel --disable-xctest` and
passed **902 tests in 131 suites**. The incident, guardrails, and residue checks
are recorded in [`TEST_STORAGE_SAFETY.md`](TEST_STORAGE_SAFETY.md). A green test
count is not accepted as complete validation unless live storage is also proven
unchanged.

---

## Settings sidebar parity (2026-09-11)

The Intel sidebar follows upstream's section sequence and row ordering for every
settings surface that exists in this fork: General, Models, Agents,
Capabilities, Automation, and Developer Tools. Developer Tools uses upstream's
persistent reveal switch. Do not add working-looking rows for roadmap features
before their settings surfaces exist. Local Models, Voice, and Sandbox remain
disabled together under **Not Available on This Mac**, immediately before the
Developer Tools footer section, so the upstream organization stays recognizable
without misrepresenting Intel support.

The Orchestrator chain is documented as an Intel dependency-ordered plan and
focused test contract in [`ORCHESTRATOR_INTEL_PLAN.md`](ORCHESTRATOR_INTEL_PLAN.md).
Intel Gates 1–4 provide persistent built-in configuration, a real settings route,
effective runtime model/prompt/generation resolution, and a manual one-turn
delegation sheet. Gate 4 admits only explicitly selected custom agents and remote
cloud models; Ask/Deny/Always Allow is scoped to the exact launcher/target pair;
the child is fresh, one-turn, one-at-a-time, tool-free, bounded by input/tokens/
output/timeout, cancellable, and returned as inline text. M4 automated validation
and the x86_64 build are recorded separately from pending Rosy Ventura QA.
Child tools and model-owned autonomous delegation remain later dependency/backlog
work because Intel cloud tool-loop limits are not request-scoped.

## 2026-09-11 — Bounded Intel Orchestrator Gate 4

Gate 4 is implemented as the smallest user-facing text path. The manual sheet
requires explicit admission for both the custom-agent target and its remote model,
rechecks availability before dispatch, and persists the exact target-pair
permission choice. It supports Ask, Deny, and Always Allow, with Ask producing a
per-run approval. The runtime creates one fresh child request, suppresses child
tools and nested spawning, permits one active child globally, enforces input,
token, output, and timeout limits, handles cancellation, and displays a bounded
inline result.

This is Partial product parity until Rosy Ventura validates the built UI and live
behavior. No durable child session, filesystem artifact, queue, background
continuation, or model-owned spawn is claimed. Child tools and model-owned
autonomous delegation stay in the later dependency/backlog because Intel cloud
tool-loop limits are not request-scoped.

## Rosy titlebar-control report (2026-09-11)

A screenshot appeared to show missing close, minimize, and zoom controls on Rosy.
The first M4 reproduction attempt was invalid: macOS placed its screen-sharing
indicator directly over the traffic-light area, and the app under inspection was
initially a current upstream build rather than the Intel fork. Accessibility still
reported all three standard controls in the isolated Intel build, but that does
not prove their appearance on Ventura. Do not infer a titlebar regression or land
a speculative fix from a captured screenshot. Validate directly on Rosy with
screen sharing stopped, then record the Ventura result and any confirmed cause.

---

## Post-sync restoration: Knowledge and the full Project page (2026-09-08)

The two deferrals recorded below are now resolved. Intel Knowledge is a real,
local collection registry and encrypted semantic index, backed by the same
pure-Swift embedding path already proven by Memory. Projects now expose the
upstream-style split page with shared instructions, selectable Knowledge
collections, a default agent, shared memory preview/deep-link, and a working
folder inherited by new chats.

Working folders are owned by each chat, persisted in its session JSON, and
resolved through a task-local root during tool execution. This matters for
multi-window safety: choosing a folder in one chat cannot silently redirect
another chat's file tools. Claude Code also receives the active chat folder as
its process working directory. Project recall is additive to agent-scoped
personal recall; project transcripts and distilled episodes continue to build
when personal memory is disabled for that agent.

Validation at this checkpoint: the package build passed, and **793 tests in
120 suites** passed, including concurrent working-folder isolation and legacy
project/session decoding. The signed canonical x86_64 Rosy workspace build also
passed and produced the deployable app.

## Sync 0.24.3 → 0.24.7 (2026-09-07)

**Range:** `4528b56f..7e109ade` — **53 commits**. Deterministic exclusion triage produced
33 review candidates, 8 new-subsystem-only commits, 5 infrastructure-only commits,
5 release/docs-only commits, and 2 excluded-only commits. The 33 survivors were read
individually; the complete ledger is
[`UPSTREAM_TRIAGE_0.24.7.md`](UPSTREAM_TRIAGE_0.24.7.md).

**Ported:** the Full Disk Access system-TCC/SQLite-header probe pair; Claude split-export
index and batch-ZIP import guidance; project-aware New Chat; ⌘B sidebar and next-agent
shortcuts; folder-chip accessibility; metadata-only session hydration; UTF-8 token
estimation; and the lock-backed tool-configuration quit drain. The CLI launch fallback
also now waits for the application process instead of mistaking cold server startup for
a failed launch.

**Deferred at this checkpoint (subsequently resolved above):** project folders needed
per-chat folder ownership before they could be safe on Intel, and clickable Knowledge
links waited for the local-first Knowledge milestone. The browser-tab/history shell is a
larger reconciliation with the Intel Projects and toolbar structure. Local vMLX/MTP,
local-model residency, upstream
agent-loop/delegation, sandbox, skill mutation, and upstream appcast changes remain skips.

As in the previous sync, every useful change was hand-ported. No upstream commit was
cherry-picked wholesale.

**Validation:** `swift test --no-parallel` passed **715 tests in 107 suites**;
`swift build --arch x86_64` passed; and the unsigned x86_64 workspace build passed
with deployment target macOS 13.

## Completed sync: 0.20.3 → 0.24.3 (triaged 2026-09-02, implemented 2026-09-02/03)

**Range:** `9124d696..4528b56f` — **783 commits**, upstream `0.20.3` → `0.24.3` (+17 untagged).
**Status: Waves A–E are ported and committed on `sync/0.24.3` / `intel-fork`; nothing is released
yet.** See *Sync execution log* at the end of this section. The triage below is what the work was
planned from; the staged execution plan lives in
[`SYNC_0.24.3_PLAN.md`](SYNC_0.24.3_PLAN.md), and the full per-commit verdict table (all 476
reviewed commits) is in [`UPSTREAM_TRIAGE_0.24.3.md`](UPSTREAM_TRIAGE_0.24.3.md).

**Shape of the work (decided 2026-09-02): three releases.**

| Release | Contents |
|---|---|
| `1.0.32` Stabilize | keychain + Router hotfixes, then the Sentry crash/hang set |
| `1.0.33` Modernize | fast-forward the 52 PORT-touched pristine files, then proxy + MCP |
| `1.0.34` **Projects** | `8a9d32ea` rebuilt against the Intel mirrors, then the rest of chat QoL |

Backlogged: `311d9095` (storage encryption — gated on root-causing Rosy's `hmac` decrypt error)
and the 61-commit deferred shelf (re-triage after 1.0.34).

### How this triage was produced

A deterministic classifier (not judgment) first eliminated **307 of 783** by parsing the
164-path `exclude:` list straight out of `Packages/OsaurusCore/Package.swift` and intersecting
it with each commit's touched files:

| Auto-bucket | Count | Rule |
|---|---:|---|
| IGNORE | 92 | docs / `.github` / appcast / `.xcstrings` / evals only |
| NEW-SUBSYSTEM | 90 | touches **only files absent from the fork** — brand-new upstream subsystems |
| INFRA-ONLY | 76 | only `Package.resolved` / `Package.swift` / xcworkspace — vmlx repin churn |
| SKIP | 49 | every touched file is on the `exclude:` list |
| **REVIEW** | **476** | touches ≥1 file the Intel target actually compiles |

The 476 survivors were then split into 5 chronological windows and judged individually.

### Verdict totals (476 reviewed)

| Verdict | Count |
|---|---:|
| ✅ PORT | **211** |
| ⛔️ SKIP | 204 |
| ⏸️ DEFER | 61 |

| Window | Upstream range | Tags | PORT | SKIP | DEFER |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| W1 | `b8ef10aa..3bee1703` | 0.20.3 → 0.21.0 | 52 | 32 | 12 |
| W2 | `f09b2123..a15efa73` | 0.21.0 → 0.21.13 | 40 | 45 | 11 |
| W3 | `93e6394e..5bb946f7` | 0.21.13 → 0.22.9 | 26 | 61 | 9 |
| W4 | `d417cdf9..c4d9d140` | 0.22.9 → 0.22.20 | 57 | 29 | 10 |
| W5 | `4e2bcb03..e03127e7` | 0.22.20 → 0.24.3 | 36 | 37 | 19 |

> ⚠️ **Confidence caveat.** The per-commit verdicts are a **first-pass triage by small models**,
> not a review. They are a map of where to dig, not an authorization to cherry-pick. Verify each
> commit against fork reality before it lands. Known first-pass errors already corrected:
> Product Hunt marketing dialogs (`f8b1c02e`, `67eeaf0b`) were mislabelled PORT; the
> swap-pressure banner series (`a9d2a150`, `29fedb38`, `1b58dcf9`) warns about *local model*
> RAM pressure and is meaningless on a cloud-only fork.

### Why 783 collapses to 211

Upstream spent this era building an **agent-orchestration platform**: Orchestrator + delegation,
Agent Channels (Telegram/iMessage), subagent batching, Computer Use + AppleScript, Skills,
Knowledge base, Browser Use, image/video generation, and a community model-compat leaderboard.
The fork amputates every one of those. This is not drift — it is a divergence of *purpose*.
Upstream went agentic-multiplayer; the Intel fork is sovereign cloud inference on old metal.

### The five PORT clusters

1. **Cloud provider & Router hardening** — the fork's lifeline.
   `5f12d260` (remote-provider crashes/hangs, endpoint trust, **Router spend safety**, streaming) ·
   `563f9174` (Router 409 idempotency on refunded iterations) · `6ecd2133` (credits UI dollars→credits) ·
   `89ccb249` + `757807f9` (redeemable credit codes) · `0a8c5008` (providers stuck disconnected after
   relaunch) · `577a3eee` (honor custom-provider context windows) · `4137884f` (media rejection recovery
   + OpenAI hardening) · `f9478c0f` (lenient decode for nonstandard streaming chunks during tool calls) ·
   `f01e5d44` (xAI OAuth stale catalog) · `bbad6ed9` (Fireworks only showing 6 models)
2. **Keychain & identity** — `984debe2` (harden keychain on relaunch + identity restore from recovery
   phrase) · `e06996e3` (specific keychain errors, recover ACL-denied credential saves). Directly on top
   of the fork's stable-signing-identity scar tissue.
3. **Crashes & main-thread hangs** — Sentry-triaged, generic AppKit/SwiftUI: `03ea4c93`, `c8be96cc`,
   `99537680`, `6daf54cb`, `dfd412f6`, `0d07b052` (notch display-reconfig + TextKit), `3ba84c38`,
   `2eac8d32`, `286c4a9a`, `cc6732d7`, `161e6ca5`.
4. **Chat QoL** — full-text search + ⌘F (`5ada76dc`) · Projects/chat grouping (`8a9d32ea`) · pinned chats
   (`6ae20356`) · multi-select delete/archive (`479133ba`) · auto chat titles (`5bb946f7`) + `/title`
   (`3580502c`) · import from ChatGPT/Claude/Grok (`311f327c`, `48c6d197`) · delete individual messages
   (`c4d9d140`) · ⌘N (`e0eeba12`) · ⌘± zoom (`1b955c2b`) · resizable sidebar (`035ed272`) · inline +
   display LaTeX (`f3608d88`, `8a8f01ec`) · escape-eats-your-prompt fix (`08eb8bd8`) · LLM context
   compaction (`ce414b3f`) · `96b05d20` (hide local-memory warnings for cloud models).
5. **Storage, proxy, MCP** — `311d9095` (storage encryption opt-in, 50 files — SQLCipher, handle with
   tongs) · `9ddb49b0` (migration hardening) · `304ad2bb` + `0ba6a01a` + `52d4aa9b` (global proxy) ·
   `774aa836` (MCP session recovery + OAuth single-flight) · `3f4791e7` (paginated tool discovery) ·
   `12ff17c7` (bearer 401 classification) · `f5009855` (MCP URL detection in provider form).

### Blanket SKIP (do not revisit)

Orchestrator / delegation (`8d7c3dd4` alone is a 195-file refactor), Agent Channels + Telegram +
iMessage, Computer Use + AppleScript, Skills, Browser Use, image/video generation,
every MTP / speculative-decoding / vMLX repin, the entire evals harness + community leaderboard,
Sandbox, and upstream's own marketing modals (Product Hunt, "what's new" for amputated features).

> **Not blanket-SKIP: the Knowledge base.** It was previously written off as permanently
> amputated because it needs embeddings. That is obsolete — the fork's pure-Swift model2vec
> `potion-base-8M` static embedder already runs acceptably on Rosy (it powers local semantic
> memory). Knowledge is therefore **viable on Intel and wanted**, just not in this sync. See
> the backlog in [`SYNC_0.24.3_PLAN.md`](SYNC_0.24.3_PLAN.md) §10.

### Sync execution log (2026-09-02/03)

| Commit | Wave | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `9ca6c90f` | A — keychain / Router / provider | 7 candidates → 4 partial ports, 3 dissolved to SKIP |
| `56e3a422..0680502c` | B — crashes & hangs | 11 candidates → 8 hand-ported, 3 SKIP |
| `1c84bf11` | build | `swift-secp256k1` → 0.23.2 (Swift 6.4; see the pin note above) |
| `52cf68ce` | C — pristine fast-forward | 50 selected → 33 landed, 17 reverted as coupled |
| `7b816ca5` | E′ — proxy & MCP | 8 candidates → 5 ported/partial, 3 SKIP |
| `c53a84f0` | D₀ — **Projects** + math | rebuilt against Intel mirrors; knowledge dimension dropped |
| `b1c68b3b` | D₁a — search, pinned chats, multi-select | salvaged after a rate-limit interruption |
| `2d6ee24d` | D₁b — titles, import, delete, resize, shortcuts | 9 ported, 1 declined, 1 SKIP |

**Two numbers worth carrying into the next sync:** **zero** upstream commits applied as a clean
cherry-pick — every single one needed hand-porting or reverting. And **~31%** of first-pass PORT
verdicts dissolved once checked against what the fork actually compiles. Budget for verification,
not transcription.

**Not ported, deliberately:** `ce414b3f` (LLM context compaction — ~3800 lines tied to local
warm-up and KV-cache machinery this fork lacks) and `96b05d20` (hides local RAM/swap warnings that
do not exist here). Both belong to the backlog, not to a future retry-as-is.

## Sync 0.20.3 → `9124d696` — global-proxy batch (2026-06-17, Session 10)

12 commits in `7901ec42..9124d696`, all the upstream "Route X through global proxy" series
(threading network calls through `GlobalProxySettings`) plus a couple of fixes. **Ported (4):**

| Upstream | Intel action |
|---|---|
| `23aaa5cc` | router API → global proxy — our `OsaurusRouterAPIClient` (uses `makeSession(base:)` verbatim) |
| `572273a8` | theme API → global proxy — `ThemesAPIClient` (`makeSession(base:)` verbatim) |
| `62755e65` | markdown image downloads → proxy — `MarkdownImageView` + `NativeMarkdownView`; mapped upstream's `sharedSession()` → our `makeSession()` |
| `17f27b4f` | sandbox-plugin manifest fetch → proxy — `SandboxPlugin.fromURL`; `sharedSession()` → `makeSession()` |

> **Proxy-API note:** Intel's `GlobalProxySettings` exposes only `makeSession()` (fresh per
> call), not upstream's cached `sharedSession()`/`currentProxyCacheKey()`. Every upstream
> `sharedSession()` consumer maps to `makeSession()` — functionally equivalent (always honors the
> current proxy), just uncached. Do NOT port `currentProxyCacheKey()`; it only serves the caching design we don't use.

**SKIP (excluded/absent/divergent):** `07ba93e1` (MCP OAuth → proxy — our MCP OAuth is divergent;
`MCPOAuthHTTPTransport`/`noRedirectSession` absent, no valid target), `6e47dfe9` (`SandboxManager`
excluded), `7dc814bf` (`RelayTunnelManager` excluded), `5621ef11` (`RemoteAgentManager` excluded),
`217c8c7d` (`PrivacyFilterModelDownloader` absent — model-download subsystem), `8247f63a`
(`GitHubSkillService` excluded), `9124d696` (`ShareArtifactTool` excluded).
**DEFER:** `395fe51e` (allow manual provider models during connection tests — needs a `manualModelIds:`
param threaded through the excluded/mirrored `IntelStubConformers.testConnection` for a niche
Azure-deployment onboarding flow; ~zero value for Intel's cloud-DeepSeek path).

## Sync 0.20.0 → 0.20.3 (2026-06-14, Session 9)

21 commits in `24924e6f..7901ec42`. **Ported (7):**

| Upstream | Intel action |
|---|---|
| `8dd49a65` | Codex OAuth diagnostic context (`ProviderNetworkDiagnostics`) |
| `4569b76f` | OAuth → global proxy — adapted `GlobalProxySettings.sharedSession()` (unported) → `makeSession()` |
| `13bb8b47` | configurable Hugging Face cache path (down-leveled the new `onChange`) |
| `ef180dd8` | local access-key lifecycle — `AccessKeyLifecycleService`; ServerView adapted (`ServerController` excluded → server is loopback-only) |
| `7901ec42` | **partial** — ChatView static `ISO8601DateFormatter` cache (main-thread alloc); `PluginRepositoryService` part skipped (excluded) |
| `6c18cb91` | **partial** — `ToolConfigurationStore` only; the ToolsManagerView tools-section hang fix needs the **unported `37a2291b` `ToolAvailability`** + a card refactor that would lose the M16 blank-gap fix |
| `bd0e196d`+`54d650ba` | `Localizable.xcstrings` full-file from upstream |

**SKIP (excluded/divergent):** `b768bbcb` (RemoteProviderService — Intel uses CloudChatEngine),
`9e390950` (PluginHostAPI), `33c41661`/`8ff06de3` (host stdio MCP → excluded `SandboxStdioRunner`),
`dee498b8` (ToolIndexService/CapabilityTools), `e5419a3b` (MLX kv-cache), `5b3c2fa6` (paste-URL — a
*fix* to a feature Intel's divergent `RemoteProviderEditSheet` never had). **DEFER:** `e8bcba8a`
(onboarding model-selection — mixed with excluded RemoteProviderManager/ToolIndexService).
**IGNORE:** 3 appcasts, `44bc8ae6` (whats-new), `ae34ca6a` (legacy storage marker).

> **Versioning note:** the fork keeps its **own** version line (`1.0.x`) — we do
> NOT peg it to upstream's number (the fork amputates whole subsystems, so a
> pegged number would imply false parity). The upstream correspondence is shown
> as *metadata* in the About panel + release notes, sourced from a single
> constant: `IntelBuildInfo.upstreamBase` / `upstreamCommit`. Keep that constant
> in lockstep with the two values above.

## Sync 0.19.15 → 0.20.0 (2026-06-14, Session 6)

95 commits in `d132b728..24924e6f`. The exclude-list amputates MLX/memory/skills/
slash-registry/sandbox/p2p, so most were SKIP. **Ported (15 substantive):**

| Area | Upstream | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| tok/s accuracy | `26573b24` | new `RollingTokenRate` (shared) |
| image context tokens | `0da56927` | `Attachment` resolution-based estimate |
| theme button colors | `0c5b4bf0` | `ThemeEditorView` |
| raw JSON theme editor | `15df6096` | new `ThemeJSONEditorCodec` + editor; resolved union with the bg-decode hang fix |
| theme-editor + watcher hang | `76a07e24` | bg image decode off-main (`decodeThemeBackgroundImage`) |
| fatal crashes | `62191278` | only `ModelMediaCapabilities` applies — PrivacyFilter is DU (Intel lacks it); `osaurusApp` kept ours |
| quit/plugin-teardown crash | `0168ff40` | `ExternalPlugin`/`DebugLog`; `AppDelegate` kept ours (excluded teardown deps), `TelemetryService` DU |
| ClipboardService main-thread hang | `f1b069de` `374e3190` `1bb474c1` | pasteboard XPC moved off-main (recurring fix; `ModelDetailView`/`ManagementBadgeStore` kept ours) |
| tool-envelope hang | `69753ad8` | `ToolEnvelope` shared; `ToolRegistry` excluded (took theirs, dead code) |
| chat-jump-on-completion | `2c4d6089` | **merged** into our Intel `handlePostSnapshotScroll` — kept our `isNewTurn`/`wasPinnedToBottom` structure, added the `isStreaming` gate |
| sidebar rename | `24a5e3e9` | sidebar UI auto-merged; the view-model sync (`session.title`/`archived`) hand-ported into Intel `ChatContentView` callbacks (chat layout is extracted on Intel) |
| visual/interaction polish | `3a4edaae` | theme polish (CustomTheme/Theme/AgentInlineBlocks) only; `FloatingInputCard` budget-tint kept ours (needs excluded `ContextBudgetManager`), `ShimmerLabel` DU dropped |
| localization | `392954aa` … `e6894ce5` | full-file `Localizable.xcstrings` from upstream (both Intel strings present) |

**SKIP (bulk):** all vMLX pins + Gemma/DiffusionGemma/MLX runtime + memory/episodes +
skills/slash-registry + WindowManager/ModelManager hang fixes (excluded) + appcasts/CI.

**DEFER (revisit in a focused session):**
- `58aab452` **hosted inference** (0.20.0 marquee) — `ContentBlock`/`ChatTurn`/`OpenAIAPI`/
  `RemoteProviderManager` mirrored/excluded; conflicts with `CloudChatEngine`.
- `a39b2d89` **p2p e2e encryption** — isolated `Identity/*` pairing; not exposed on Intel.
- `7068b131` **sandbox-by-default** — `BuiltinSandboxTools`/`SandboxToolRegistrar` excluded.
- `2a58c239` + `ae4541d4` **model-picker UX** — Intel's `ModelPickerView` diverged
  (`cachedGroupedOptions`/`groupedBySource()` vs upstream's `rebuildTabs()` tabs); reconcile later.
- `c2231910` slash command (excluded registry), `4a9a23f0` system prompts (excluded composer),
  `37a2291b`/`be43da1a` tool/MCP diagnostics (excluded deps), `3a743373` external-model-mgmt
  (Intel-kept `ModelDetailView`/`AppDelegate`), `e6b78e36` onboarding polish, `fc1626c6` whats-new.

### Deferred-shelf deep dive (2026-06-14, Session 7)

Re-examined the deferral list for faithful portability. Outcome:

**✅ Ported faithfully:**
- `c2231910` **`/agent` slash command** — `SlashCommand` + picker UI (`SharedHeaderComponents`)
  applied verbatim; `chatToolbarOpenAgentPicker` was added only to `ChatWindowManager`'s
  `#if !OSAURUS_INTEL` branch, so it was **mirrored into `IntelDataConformers`** and the listener
  bridged into the Intel `IntelToolbarAgentView` (`openPickerTrigger` + `.onReceive`) so the command
  actually opens the picker. (3× two-param `onChange` down-leveled for Ventura.)
- `3a743373` **prune-deleted external models** — `ExternalModelLocator` +`pruneMissing()` call in
  `ModelPickerView`. The reveal-in-Finder **UI** lives in the divergent `ModelDetailView` → kept ours.

**🧱 Architecturally incompatible (NOT faithfully portable — rooted in amputated subsystems):**
- `a39b2d89` **p2p e2e** — crypto is self-contained but its transport (`BonjourBrowser`/
  `RelayTunnelManager`) is excluded; encrypting a channel Intel never opens = dead code. *(still blocked)*
- `be43da1a` **local MCP probe** — `MCPProviderProbeService` hard-needs excluded `SandboxStdioRunner`. *(still blocked)*

**🔧 Ported as Intel glue (Session 8, 2026-06-14 — `dfcc19cc`):**
- `58aab452` **hosted inference / "Osaurus Router"** — initially called incompatible, but
  `CloudChatEngine` already routes to any OpenAI-compatible provider via the stubbed
  `RemoteProviderManager`, so it WAS doable as a glue port. The "wallet" is the user's
  existing Osaurus identity (EIP-191 `deriveOsaurusId`→EVM address), not a separate wallet.
  Added `.osaurusRouter` provider type, the self-contained Router/credits files, a managed
  provider registration + signed catalog fetch in the stub, request signing in
  `CloudChatEngine` (stream+complete), and a `ManagementTab.credits` entry. Dropped the
  redundant `OpenAICompatibleStreamParser` (CloudChatEngine streams natively) and decoupled
  `StorageMutationGate`/`FeatureTelemetry`/insights cross-refs. **Compiles app-wide; live use
  needs a funded router account (untested).** Composer credits-chip deferred.
- `a39b2d89` **p2p e2e** — crypto is self-contained but its transport (`BonjourBrowser`/
  `RelayTunnelManager`) is excluded; encrypting a channel Intel never opens = dead code.
- `be43da1a` **local MCP probe** — `MCPProviderProbeService` hard-needs excluded `SandboxStdioRunner`.

**⏭ Skipped / needs-rewrite:** `2a58c239`+`ae4541d4` model-picker (Intel's grouping model would need
re-architecting to upstream's tabs — not a faithful diff), `7068b131` sandbox-default (enforcement in
excluded `BuiltinSandboxTools`), `fc1626c6` whats-new (keyed on excluded sandbox/pairing), `e6b78e36`
onboarding polish (low value).

## Sync workflow (monthly)

```bash
git fetch upstream
# Only NEW commits since last sync — never reparse old ones
git log d132b728..upstream/main --oneline
# Classify → PORT/SKIP/MIRROR → cherry-pick/ignore → update this ledger
# When done:
#   1. update the "Last synced upstream commit" hash + "Upstream version era" above
#   2. update IntelBuildInfo.swift (upstreamBase + upstreamCommit) to match
#      — that constant feeds the About panel and the release-notes footer.
```  

---

## Triage Rubric

```
For each upstream commit:
  git show --stat <commit>

  IF all files in Package.resolved + Package.swift
    → SKIP "vMLX version pin"

  IF all files in exclude: list AND no Intel mirror exists
    → SKIP "amputated subsystem"

  IF all files in test directories
    → IGNORE "test-only"

  IF any file in exclude: list WITH an Intel conformer mirror
    → MIRROR "re-implement in <conformer file>"

  IF all files in shared (non-excluded, non-test) code
    → PORT — cherry-pick

  IF mixed (some shared, some excluded)
    → EVALUATE — port shared subset, skip excluded
```

## Perpetual Conflict Files (always `--ours`)

- `Package.swift` — different dependencies, exclude list, OSAURUS_INTEL flag
- `Package.resolved` — different dependency graph

> **Deliberate pin divergence (2026-09-02): `swift-secp256k1` is `exact: "0.23.2"` here,
> while upstream stays on `exact: "0.21.1"`.** 0.21.1 does not compile under Swift 6.4:
> `UInt256` declares both `SIMDWordsInteger` and `UnsignedInteger`, both of which require
> `words`, and the newer compiler rejects `for word in words` as ambiguous
> (`P256K/UInt256.swift:215`) — even though the package already declares
> `swiftLanguageModes: [.v5]`. This breaks **every** commit including untouched baselines, in
> both architectures, so it is not sync damage. Upstream has not hit it because they are not on
> 6.4 yet. 0.23.2 builds clean with no source changes on our side. When upstream eventually
> bumps their pin, drop this divergence and follow them.
>
> **Knock-on effect — build-tool plugin validation.** 0.23.2 ships a
> `SharedSourcesPlugin` build-tool plugin that 0.21.1 did not. Xcode refuses to run an
> unvalidated package plugin from the command line, so `xcodebuild` dies at
> *"Validate plug-in SharedSourcesPlugin"* **before compiling a single file**, while
> `swift build` is unaffected — which makes it invisible to the usual Ventura build check.
> `scripts/build/build_rosy.sh` (the release path, called from `cut_intel_release.sh`) and
> `scripts/build/build_arm64.sh` therefore pass `-skipPackagePluginValidation
> -skipMacroValidation`. Without them the release ceremony fails with three lines of output
> and no obvious cause. Remove these flags if the secp256k1 pin is ever reverted.
- `RuntimePolicySourceTests.swift` — vMLX source-policy tests

### Intel-Specific Fixups (commit `8f86d6d5`)

| Fix | Reason |
|---|---|
| RemoteProviderEditSheet.swift reverted to Intel version | Upstream file depends on unported types (ProviderTextField, ProviderSecureField, OpenAICodexOAuthService, disableTimeout) |
| Package.swift: exclude RemoteReasoningPolicy.swift | Depends on excluded ThinkingConfig / RemoteProviderService |
| Stripped `public` from OAuthSignInCoordinator + ProviderCredentialInstructions | Intel module is internal; upstream uses library visibility |
| Re-added `#if !OSAURUS_INTEL` guards to 5 onboarding files | Lost during `--theirs` conflict resolution |
| Removed duplicate ProviderInputFields.swift | Intel defines ProviderTextField/ProviderSecureField inline in RemoteProviderEditSheet |

---

## Stats

- **Total upstream commits processed:** 44 substantive + ~97 vMLX pins + ~38 xcstrings
- **Sessions:** 5 (2026-06-07/2026-06-08) | **Fully caught up to upstream/main** ✅

---

## Deferred / watch-list

- **Chat "bubble" rendering for thoughts + tool-calls.** The Apple-Silicon
  Osaurus renders reasoning/tool-call blocks in a newer "bubble" style; Intel
  renders the 0.19.15 "card" style. The `Native*` chat views
  (`NativeThinkingView`, `NativeToolCallGroupView`, `NativeMessageCellView`,
  `NativeBlockViews` — ~5.3k lines of hand-tuned AppKit) are SHARED, not
  Intel-divergent, so this is **not** an Intel reimplementation — it's a newer
  upstream redesign. It is NOT in the 41 commits after `d132b728` (by subject).
  **Decision (Renée, 2026-06-11): do NOT reinvent it.** If a future upstream
  sync brings the redesign as a real commit, port it then. Otherwise leave the
  card style as-is.

---

## ⚠️ Intel-owned files & post-sync verification (GUARDRAIL)

The `9b79161b` / App-Intents syncs silently **reverted** Intel customizations by
taking "theirs" on cherry-picks (found + fixed in 1.0.15): the README was
replaced with upstream's, and `RemoteProviderKeychain` lost its Intel isolation.
These compile fine reverted, so they slip through. **After EVERY sync, verify
these Intel-owned customizations survived:**

| File | Must contain (Intel) | Not (upstream) |
|---|---|---|
| `README.md` | `🦕 Osaurus (Intel)` header, "Run a model locally" | `Own your AI`, `brew install --cask osaurus` |
| `Packages/OsaurusCore/Services/Provider/RemoteProviderKeychain.swift` | `ai.osaurus.remote.intel` (`#if OSAURUS_INTEL`) | bare `ai.osaurus.remote` only |
| `Packages/OsaurusCore/Services/MCP/MCPProviderKeychain.swift` | `ai.osaurus.mcp.intel` | bare `ai.osaurus.mcp` only |
| `App/osaurus/Info.plist` | `SUFeedURL` → `reneezmp/osaurus-intel`, `SUPublicEDKey` `7Nh8jSxF…` | `osaurus-ai` / missing |
| `scripts/release/cut_intel_release.sh` | `REPO="reneezmp/osaurus-intel"` | upstream repo |
| `scripts/build/build_rosy.sh` | bakes `OsaurusCanonicalData` | — |
| `Packages/OsaurusCore/Identity/MasterKey.swift` (DO NOT isolate) | `com.osaurus.account`, synchronizable — **shared identity, leave as-is** | a `.intel` variant (would fracture identity) |

**Revert-detector** (run after each sync — lists Swift files that lost ALL their
Intel guards vs the last known-good tag):

```bash
comm -23 \
  <(git grep -l OSAURUS_INTEL <good-tag> -- '*.swift' | sed 's/^[^:]*://' | sort -u) \
  <(git grep -l OSAURUS_INTEL HEAD       -- '*.swift' | sed 's/^[^:]*://' | sort -u)
```

**Rule:** the README, the two provider/MCP keychain service names, the updater
config (Info.plist), and the release/build scripts are Intel-owned — on a
cherry-pick conflict, ALWAYS keep ours. The Master Key (`com.osaurus.account`)
is the opposite: shared + iCloud-synced identity, never give it an Intel variant.

## ⚠️ Ventura (macOS 13) backport maintenance (Phase B, 2026-06-12)

The deployment target is **macOS 13**, enforced by the compiler. After every
upstream sync, the build will fail on any new API that requires 14+. Recurring
categories to watch for:

| Pattern | Fix |
|---|---|
| `@Observable` macro | Convert to `ObservableObject` + `@Published` |
| `.onChange(of:){ _, v in }` | Down-level to `{ v in }` (bulk Perl regex available) |
| `.onChange(of:){ named, v in }` | Manual: `@State` prev-value var |
| `.symbolEffect` | Remove or `.contentTransition(.opacity)` |
| `.activateAllWindows` | Use `.activateIgnoringOtherApps` |
| new 14+ decorative APIs | Plain 13-compatible replacement (no `#available` gates) |

**Post-sync Ventura build check:**
```bash
cd Packages/OsaurusCore && swift build --arch x86_64
```
Fix every "only available in macOS 14/15" error, rebuild, repeat until clean.

## 2026-09-08 — Claude Code Intel hand-port and deferred-verdict correction

- Ported the useful core of upstream `eca456c3` without the excluded MLX service registry or MCP bridge: executable discovery, CLI-owned authentication, safe text-only streaming, Claude model aliases, settings setup/status, cancellation, and child-process teardown.
- The CLI receives prompts on stdin, runs statelessly, ignores user MCP servers, and has every built-in tool disabled in this first slice. Osaurus does not read or store Claude credentials.
- Verified current Anthropic requirements support macOS 13 and x64. The setup screen uses the current native installer and discovers its `~/.local/bin/claude` launcher.
- Re-audited all 73 historical `DEFER` rows. The authoritative correction is `docs/DEFER_FEASIBILITY_AUDIT_2026-09-08.md`: 58 are feasible Intel work (1 landed, 28 port-next, 29 roadmap); 15 are product/runtime skips. Difficulty and mixed-file scope are no longer accepted as incompatibility reasons.
- Validation at this checkpoint: package build passes; 730 tests / 108 suites pass, including 21 Claude configuration/streaming tests. x86_64 and workspace gates follow after commit-ready review.

## 2026-09-09 — Codex catalog and Responses Lite follow-up

Rosy acceptance exposed the exact failure fixed upstream by `7d7df287` and
`7bdb440f`: querying ChatGPT's generic model catalog admits unusable `*-wm`
experiments, while current GPT-5.6 Codex models may require the catalog-driven
Responses Lite contract. The Intel engine now carries both fixes without
un-excluding the Apple-Silicon service cone: Codex catalog URL/client identity,
CLI User-Agent, `use_responses_lite` capability tracking, UUIDv7 affinity,
required Lite headers, and the Lite input-item rewrite live in the Intel OAuth,
adapter, and cloud-engine files.

This checkpoint also restores upstream's provider-qualified model identity.
Bare ids remain a compatibility input only when one provider owns them; the
wire request always receives the owner's bare model id. Do not reintroduce
global bare-id deduplication in future sync conflict resolution—it hides Router
models and breaks persisted per-agent defaults.

## 2026-09-09 — Agent settings General and Abilities mirror

Ported the upstream 0.25.0 grouped Agent-detail navigation while preserving the
fork's working Intel managers. General now exposes Configure and Appearance;
Abilities exposes Overview, Tools, Subagents, and Sandbox. Keep the Intel
availability decisions during future conflict resolution: Tools, Knowledge,
Memory, schedules/watchers, custom avatars, per-agent themes, and Claude Code
folder permissions are live; native container sandbox, native subagents,
per-agent structured databases, and the Claude-to-Osaurus MCP bridge are shown
as unavailable until their real backends land.

Agent JSON now accepts upstream `toolsEnabled` / `memoryEnabled` keys and stores
per-agent `claudeCode` settings. Intel still writes its legacy
`disableTools` / `disableMemory` keys, so the custom decoder is the compatibility
boundary and positive upstream keys take precedence when both forms are
present. Preserve `bonjourEnabled`, `order`, and `claudeCode` whenever the
editor reconstructs an Agent value.


## 2026-09-09 — Remaining Agent settings groups and route compatibility

Connections now mirrors upstream with Network, Remote Connections, and Channels nested routes. Automation and conversational Memory keep their working Intel managers, while Database has the upstream nested route shape with dependency-aware content. Preserve `AgentDetailTabRoute.swift`: it converts legacy Home/Schema/Data/Views/Activity deep links into the consolidated Database sections.

The dependency contract is `docs/INTEL_AGENT_SETTINGS_BACKLOG.md`. Bonjour, schedules/watchers, history, pinned facts, and episodes are live. Relay/workspace sharing, peer grants, Channels/outbox, and private Agent Database remain backlog items until their full Intel backends are restored.

## 2026-09-10 — Native Web Search Intel hand-port

Upstream's free/custom Web Search stack was rebuilt through the Intel-compiled
registry and prompt composer: provider catalog and ordering, built-in
fallbacks, declarative providers, Keychain credentials, test search,
Readability extraction, Settings navigation, and per-agent opt-in gating. The
legacy `search-intel` dylib is retired to prevent duplicate tool registration.
The baseline schema also includes upstream's immutable-category fix so provider
changes cannot alter the prompt prefix. Osaurus Premium routing is deferred as
an explicit Credits/Router dependency. Automated and Rosy acceptance evidence
are tracked separately in `WEB_SEARCH_TEST_PLAN.md`.

## 2026-09-10 — Agent Settings Rosy acceptance correction

The first Rosy pass disproved the automated-only classification recorded by
the Agent Settings revamp. Existing-agent model migration, runtime capability
gating, custom avatars and themes, Bonjour state, schedule/watcher management,
and memory data projection all had material failures. Ventura also exposed an
app-wide native-control rendering regression: insertion carets, switch tint,
button content, menu content, and hover feedback could be absent until
interaction.

Future settings ports must keep the feature **Partial** until the exact Intel
build has passed Rosy acceptance. Codable round trips and route tests prove the
data shape and navigation only. They do not prove migration from Renée's live
store, the model/tool set sent by an existing chat, AppKit rendering on
Ventura, or manager actions reached through the rebuilt screen. Any sentence
that says manual acceptance is pending is incompatible with **Working and
tested** status.

Intel's compiled `CloudChatEngine` also bypassed upstream `ChatEngine`'s
Insights logging because the latter is excluded from the Intel target. The
replacement engine now records streamed Chat UI success, failure, response,
usage, and tool-call data in `InsightsService`. This remains Partial until the
new Rosy retest confirms the Insights list and detail panes render the records.
The per-message diagnostic controls seen in current upstream remain part of the
separately backlogged chat-interface revamp.
