# Claude Plugins

Import full Claude plugins from any GitHub repository — skills, scheduled agents, slash commands, MCP providers, and shared `CLAUDE.md` context — as a single managed bundle.

The Plugins > Import > From GitHub flow recognises every published Anthropic plugin layout in the wild — the legacy flat skill marketplace, the directory-based plugin layout used by repos like [`anthropics/claude-for-legal`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-for-legal), and the object-shaped marketplace used by [`anthropics/claude-plugins-community`](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-community) that points at external repos pinned to a specific commit. Plugins land tagged with a stable id so the whole bundle can be reinstalled, replaced, or uninstalled as a unit.

Claude plugins live in the same **Plugins** management tab as Osaurus's native plugins. Each Claude plugin renders as a card mixed into the Installed grid (distinguished by an `Imported` badge), with version pills, an Update affordance, and a Configure button when the plugin declares `userConfig`. The legacy "Installed plugins" accordion previously shown at the top of **Skills** has been retired in this layout; **Skills** is now only for user-authored skills and the built-in defaults.

## What Gets Imported

| Plugin Artifact                       | Mapped To              | Osaurus Surface                          |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`              | Skill                  | Management → Skills                      |
| `skills/<name>/scripts/*`             | Skill reference/asset  | Attached to the owning skill             |
| `skills/<name>/references/*`          | Skill reference        | Attached to the owning skill             |
| `skills/<name>/assets/*`              | Skill asset            | Attached to the owning skill             |
| `skills/<name>/templates/*`           | Skill asset            | Attached to the owning skill             |
| `skills/<name>/*` (loose files)       | Skill reference/asset  | Attached to the owning skill             |
| `agents/<name>.md`                    | Schedule (disabled)    | Management → Schedules                   |
| `commands/<name>.md`                  | Slash command          | Available in chat input                  |
| `.mcp.json` (HTTP/SSE)                | MCP provider           | Management → Providers (MCP)             |
| `.mcp.json` (OAuth)                   | OAuth MCP provider     | Disabled, needs sign-in                  |
| `CLAUDE.md`                           | Reference file         | Attached to every imported skill         |
| `CONNECTORS.md`, `README.md`          | Reference file         | Attached to every imported skill         |

Skill instructions, attached references, slash commands, MCP tools, and the plugin's root markdown are then visible to the agent through the same automatic RAG selection used by built-in skills — no additional configuration is required.

`SKILL.md` bodies that use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/...` env-var paths or relative `../../<file>` markdown links are **rewritten at import time** to point at the local `references/` or `assets/` paths where the matching files were attached. Anything we couldn't bundle is listed in a footnote on the skill itself so the operator can see what wasn't materialised.

### Skill-local asset discovery

For every skill we import, the installer walks the skill directory:

1. Pulls every loose file at the skill root (e.g. `requirements.txt`, `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`).
2. Walks one level deep into `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/`, `templates/`.
3. Stores text-y files (`.py`, `.md`, `.json`, `.html`, …) under the skill's `references/` directory so the model can read them as part of context. Everything else goes under `assets/`.
4. Files larger than 2 MiB are skipped to keep imports bounded — surface them through the upstream repo instead.

All fetches are gated through a shared concurrency limiter (8 in-flight at a time) so plugins like `pitch-agent` (13 skills × ~5 supporting files each) don't burn through the unauthenticated GitHub rate-limit budget on a single import.

### Not Imported

- **Stdio MCP servers without sandbox support** — stdio entries are imported disabled into the Osaurus sandbox when available. If the sandbox is unavailable, they are listed in the install summary as skipped.
- **Skill-local scripts at run time** — Python helpers and similar are attached so the operator can read or re-use them, but Osaurus does not execute them; the agent reads the source text only.
- **Hooks** — Claude Code-style hook scripts are ignored.

---

## Plugin Discovery

Osaurus reads `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` from the repository root. Each plugin entry's `source` field can take **three shapes**, decoded by the `MarketplaceSource` sum type:

### 1. Directory-based (Claude plugin layout)

```json
{
  "name": "claude-for-legal",
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "commercial-legal",
      "source": "./commercial-legal",
      "description": "Drafts, reviews, and negotiates commercial agreements"
    }
  ]
}
```

When `source` is a string, Osaurus probes that path inside the marketplace repo for the artifact families above. The probes (skills, agents, commands, `CLAUDE.md`, `CONNECTORS.md`, `README.md`, `.mcp.json`) run in parallel via the GitHub Contents API.

Expected layout:

```
<source>/
├── skills/
│   └── <skill-name>/
│       ├── SKILL.md
│       ├── scripts/        ← walked one level deep
│       ├── references/
│       ├── assets/
│       └── templates/
├── agents/
│   └── <agent-name>.md
├── commands/
│   └── <command-name>.md
├── CLAUDE.md               ← attached to every skill
├── CONNECTORS.md           ← attached to every skill
├── README.md               ← attached to every skill
└── .mcp.json
```

### 2. External repo (claude-plugins-community)

```json
{
  "name": "0x",
  "source": {
    "source": "url",
    "url": "https://github.com/0xProject/0x-ai.git",
    "sha": "fdb8a21d6e3a1d933c1043e21874e432790682dc"
  }
}
```

When `source` is an object with `"source": "url"`, the plugin lives at the root of an entirely different repository. Osaurus pins fetches to the declared `sha` (preferred) or `ref`. Plugin IDs still use the **marketplace repo** so grouping/uninstall stay stable across re-imports.

### 3. External subdirectory (`git-subdir`)

```json
{
  "name": "a11y-fixer",
  "source": {
    "source": "git-subdir",
    "url": "barnburner121/claude-plugin-marketplace",
    "path": "generated-plugins/a11y-fixer",
    "ref": "main",
    "sha": "5f6b5d32d9f457dc9c2c7c0fb1d67dffc9140f33"
  }
}
```

`"git-subdir"` targets a subpath inside an external repo, again pinned at a specific commit. Used by community marketplaces that aggregate plugins from many upstream repos.

### Legacy flat marketplace

```json
{
  "name": "my-skills",
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "research-tools",
      "skills": ["skills/research-analyst.md", "skills/citation-checker.md"]
    }
  ]
}
```

When `skills` is an array of paths and no `source` is given, Osaurus uses the older flat skill picker — no agent/command/MCP discovery is performed.

### Sibling-plugin dependencies

Agent-style plugins (e.g. `pitch-agent` in `anthropics/financial-services`) often delegate to sibling skills with prose like:

> Invoke the `comps-analysis` skill to lay out trading comps.

After the plugin list loads, Osaurus fetches every agent body in the background, scans for these references, and builds a dependency graph. When the user toggles a parent plugin on, sibling plugins that own the referenced skills are auto-checked and surfaced under "Also selected — referenced by …". This makes orchestrator-style plugins work end-to-end out of the box.

---

## Importing

1. Open Management (`⌘ Shift M`) → **Plugins**.
2. Click **Import** in the header.
3. Enter the repository (`owner/repo` or full URL).
4. Pick which plugins (and which artifacts within each plugin) to install.
5. Click **Install Selected**.

If any selected plugin declares a `userConfig` block in its `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, Osaurus shows the **Configure plugin settings** sheet after install so required values can be filled in before the plugin's MCP servers spin up. Non-sensitive values are stored at `~/.osaurus/claude-plugins/userconfig/<safe-id>.json`; sensitive (`sensitive: true`) values land in the macOS Keychain under the existing plugin-secrets namespace.

The progress indicator shows `current / total` artifacts. File fetches run concurrently; mutations are applied serially on the main actor so the four backing managers stay consistent.

### Install Summary

After install, the sheet shows a per-plugin summary including:

- **Imported counts** — skills, schedules, commands, MCP providers
- **Schedules needing cron** — agent markdown files where no recurrence could be inferred. Click a row to deep-link into the schedule editor with the cron field focused.
- **MCP providers with placeholder tokens** — when `.mcp.json` uses `${VAR}`, `$VAR`, or `<token>` style env references, the provider is created without a token. Paste a real one in Management → Providers before enabling.
- **MCP servers needing OAuth sign-in** — `.mcp.json` entries with an `oauth` block (e.g. Slack, Notion in `anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins`) are imported with `authType: .oauth` and the declared `clientId` + `callbackPort` pre-populated. Open Management → Providers and click "Sign in" on each one before enabling.
- **Skipped stdio / malformed MCP entries** — listed with names so the user can tell which components did not land.
- **Errors** — any per-artifact failures (one bad skill does not abort the import).

---

## Plugin IDs

Every artifact imported by the installer is tagged with:

```
github:<owner>/<repo>/<plugin-name>
```

For example, `commercial-legal` from `anthropics/claude-for-legal` becomes:

```
github:anthropics/claude-for-legal/commercial-legal
```

The plugin id is stored on each artifact (`Skill.pluginId`, `Schedule.parameters["pluginId"]`, `SlashCommand.pluginId`, `MCPProvider.pluginId`) and powers the grouped management UI.

### Idempotent Re-install

Re-importing the same plugin always **replaces** its non-skill artifacts (schedules, commands, MCP providers) before recreating them. Skills are deduplicated by `(pluginId, name)`. This means you can safely re-run the import to pick up upstream changes without piling up duplicates.

To opt out (e.g. in tests), pass `replaceExisting: false` to `ClaudePluginInstaller.install`.

---

## Managing Installed Plugins

Imported Claude plugins render as cards in the **Plugins → Installed** grid alongside Osaurus's native `PluginCard`s. Each card shows:

- Display name, optional version pill, and an `Imported` badge
- Per-artifact chips for skill / schedule / command / MCP counts (live from the underlying managers)
- An `Update` capsule when the source's `plugin.json.version` (or marketplace entry / source SHA) is newer than what's installed
- A `Needs setup` capsule when the last install recorded follow-up work or declared component counts exceed the live imported artifacts
- Ellipsis menu: **View Details**, **Open on GitHub**, **Configure Settings…** (when `userConfig` is declared), **Update** (when newer), **Uninstall**

Tapping a card opens **Claude Plugin Detail** with the full hero (icon, displayName, version, license, author/homepage/repository badges, description), keyword chips, per-artifact list (skills, schedules, slash commands, MCP servers with inline Restart for stdio servers), a **CHANGELOG** section fetched lazily from `<source>/CHANGELOG.md`, and external link badges. The same view exposes:

- A **Configure plugin settings** action that re-opens the userConfig sheet.
- An **Import needs attention** banner persisted from the last install report, including skipped MCP names, OAuth sign-in needs, placeholder-token/env-var setup, install errors, and declared-but-not-imported component counts.
- A "components declared but not yet honored" notice for unsupported manifest sections (hooks, output styles, monitors, themes, channels, LSP servers).

Uninstalling a plugin removes the corresponding skills, schedules, slash commands, and MCP providers in one shot, including any Keychain-stored MCP tokens, the persisted manifest snapshot, the per-plugin userConfig file, the cache directory, and the per-plugin `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}` directory.

Osaurus's own internal plugins (`PluginManager`, Wasm-based tool plugins) appear as the existing `PluginCard` style in the same grid — the only difference is the `Imported` badge that marks GitHub-sourced Claude plugins.

### Variable substitution

The installer applies the Claude Code variable substitution rules to MCP provider command lines, arguments, working directory, and environment:

| Token | Resolves to |
| --- | --- |
| `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` | `~/.osaurus/claude-plugins/cache/<safe-id>/` (the synthesised read-only cache of the few files Osaurus fetched for this plugin) |
| `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}` | `~/.osaurus/claude-plugins/data/<safe-id>/` (created lazily on first reference; deleted on uninstall) |
| `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}` | Best-effort current workspace root (empty string when not set) |
| `${user_config.KEY}` | Non-sensitive value from the per-plugin userConfig store. Sensitive values are *only* exposed via the subprocess environment overlay — never spliced into bodies of text. |
| `${ENV_VAR}` | Host env, but only for an allow-listed set (`PATH`, `HOME`, `USER`, `HOSTNAME`, `LANG`, `LC_ALL`, `TERM`) plus any names the plugin explicitly declares in `userConfig`. |

When the installer launches an MCP subprocess (today, only those reachable from Osaurus's transport), it overlays `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`, `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA`, and a `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_OPTION_<KEY>` for every userConfig value so MCP servers behave like they would under Claude Code.

### Versioning and updates

The card shows the version captured at install. Resolution order (spec):

1. `version` in `<source>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (canonical).
2. `version` in the marketplace plugin entry.
3. Short SHA (first 7 chars) of the source path's HEAD commit.
4. `nil` (no version shown).

A background probe runs when the Plugins tab first appears and whenever the Refresh button is clicked. If the available version is newer (semver compare when both sides parse; string inequality otherwise), an **Update** capsule appears on the card and Update / Reinstall buttons appear in the detail view. The update flow re-fetches the source repo and calls `ClaudePluginInstaller.install(..., replaceExisting: true)` so the previously-selected artifact set is replaced in place.

### Not honored yet

The Tier-1 work in this release covers per-plugin `plugin.json`, version tracking, `userConfig`, variable substitution, persistent data dir, CHANGELOG/homepage/repository/keywords surfacing. The following spec features are detected and recorded but **not executed** — the detail view displays a "declared but not yet honored" notice so plugin authors aren't blindsided:

- `hooks` (pre/post-compact, pre-tool-use, etc.)
- `lspServers`
- `outputStyles`
- `experimental.themes`, `experimental.monitors`
- `channels`
- `bin/` PATH exports
- Install scopes (`user` / `project` / `local` / `managed`) — Osaurus is single-host.

---

## Cron Inference

Scheduled agents (`agents/*.md`) carry natural-language frequency text in their frontmatter or body (e.g. "Run every Monday at 9am"). The installer tries to map this to a cron expression; when it can't, the schedule lands **disabled** and appears under "Schedules needing cron" in the install summary so you can open the editor and set one explicitly.

---

## MCP Provider Import

The installer reads `.mcp.json` and classifies each server entry:

| Entry shape                                              | Imported as                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `{ url, env: { API_KEY: "literal" } }`                   | Bearer-token provider (token in Keychain)    |
| `{ url, env: { API_KEY: "${VAR}" } }`                    | No-auth provider, flagged as needing token   |
| `{ url, oauth: { clientId, callbackPort } }`             | OAuth provider (`authType: .oauth`), disabled, flagged as needing sign-in |
| `{ url: "" }` (placeholder)                              | Skipped (manual setup)                       |
| `{ command, args }` (stdio)                              | Disabled sandbox stdio provider when sandbox is available; otherwise skipped |

For OAuth providers, the declared `clientId` and a `http://127.0.0.1:<callbackPort>/callback` `redirectURI` are stashed on the provider so the existing MCP OAuth service can complete the discovery + Dynamic Client Registration + PKCE handshake when the user clicks "Sign in". The provider stays disabled until that completes.

Providers are tagged with the plugin id, so uninstalling the plugin removes them and clears their Keychain secrets.

---

## Error Handling

### Rate Limiting

Unauthenticated GitHub requests are subject to a 60-per-hour limit shared across all repositories. When Osaurus detects a `403` response with `X-RateLimit-Remaining: 0`, the import sheet displays:

> GitHub rate-limited this app. Try again in ~45 minutes.

The relative time is parsed from `X-RateLimit-Reset`. Wait for the reset (or sign in to the GitHub CLI / set up a token in a future release) before retrying.

### Marketplace Not Found

If `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` is missing, the import sheet reports that the repository has no plugins. The check is case-sensitive and runs against the repo's default branch.

### Per-Artifact Failures

The installer keeps going if any single file fails to download or parse. Failures are surfaced as `errors` entries in the install summary alongside the successful imports.
