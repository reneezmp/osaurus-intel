# Agent DB & Self-Scheduling

Every Osaurus agent can opt into its own private, encrypted SQLite database **and** a single self-scheduled "next run" slot. Together they turn the agent from a stateless chat into something that remembers structured data across runs and wakes itself up to act on it — a journal that can also set its own alarm.

This is distinct from [Memory](MEMORY.md). Memory is a global, app-wide system that distills conversational context across all your chats; Agent DB is **per-agent** structured storage the agent decides on, schemas and queries via dedicated tools. You can run an agent with one, both, or neither.

> **Intel fork:** this document describes upstream. The Intel port, its
> adaptations and staging (no self-scheduling on Intel) are in
> [`AGENT_DATABASE_INTEL_PLAN.md`](AGENT_DATABASE_INTEL_PLAN.md).

This doc is the reference for developers and power users. It covers the on-disk layout, the `db_*` tool surface, the next-run scheduler, the four schedule-mode presets, and the detail-view tabs that surface all of it.

## Enabling the Database

Each agent carries an `Agent.settings.dbEnabled` flag (see [`Agent.swift`](../Packages/OsaurusCore/Models/Agent/Agent.swift)). Toggling it on does three things:

1. **Tabs appear in the detail view.** The agent management screen at [`AgentsView.swift`](../Packages/OsaurusCore/Views/Agent/AgentsView.swift) gains five DB-backed tabs — `Home`, `Schema`, `Data`, `Views`, `Activity` — gated by `DetailTab.allTabsForAgent(_:)`. Turning the flag off snaps back to the `Configure` tab so you never sit on a now-hidden DB tab with stale state.
2. **The model sees the `db_*` tools.** [`SystemPromptComposer`](../Packages/OsaurusCore/Services/Chat/SystemPromptComposer.swift) strips every `db_*` tool from the resolved tool list when `dbEnabled == false`; with it on, the agent gets the full surface listed in [Tool Reference](#tool-reference).
3. **The agent gets a fresh, empty SQLCipher database on first write.** The file is lazy-opened on demand — no I/O happens until the agent calls a `db_*` tool.

The scheduler tools (`schedule_next_run` / `cancel_next_run`) are **not** gated on `dbEnabled`. Any agent can self-schedule; the database is a separate capability.

## On-Disk Layout and Encryption

| Artifact            | Path                                              | Lifecycle                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Per-agent database  | `~/.osaurus/agents/<uuid>/db.sqlite`              | One per agent, lazy-open |
| Cross-agent slots   | `~/.osaurus/scheduler.sqlite`                     | Single global file       |

Paths are resolved by [`OsaurusPaths.agentDatabaseFile(for:)`](../Packages/OsaurusCore/Utils/OsaurusPaths.swift) and [`OsaurusPaths.schedulerDatabaseFile()`](../Packages/OsaurusCore/Utils/OsaurusPaths.swift). Both files are opened through [`EncryptedSQLiteOpener`](../Packages/OsaurusCore/Storage/EncryptedSQLiteOpener.swift) with the device-scoped key from [`StorageKeyManager`](../Packages/OsaurusCore/Identity/StorageKeyManager.swift) — the same SQLCipher stack used by chat history, memory, and the rest of the app. See [STORAGE.md](STORAGE.md) for the key-management details.

The lazy-open lifecycle and per-agent singleton connection live in [`AgentDatabaseStore`](../Packages/OsaurusCore/Storage/AgentDatabaseStore.swift); the engine itself is [`AgentDatabase`](../Packages/OsaurusCore/Storage/AgentDatabase.swift).

---

## System Columns and the Soft-Delete Convention

Every table the agent creates via `db_create_table` is augmented with three reserved columns:

| Column         | Type        | Set by host  | Meaning                                        |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `_created_at`  | `TEXT` ISO  | host         | Set on insert. Never updated.                  |
| `_updated_at`  | `TEXT` ISO  | host         | Refreshed on `db_update` / `db_upsert` writes. |
| `_deleted_at`  | `TEXT` ISO  | host         | `NULL` for live rows; ISO timestamp once soft-deleted. |

`db_delete` is a **soft delete**: it stamps `_deleted_at` rather than removing the row. `db_restore` clears the stamp. `db_query` filters out rows with a non-null `_deleted_at` by default — pass `includeDeleted: true` to see them.

The Data tab's `Active` / `Deleted` / `All` segmented control (in [`AgentDBTabViews.swift`](../Packages/OsaurusCore/Views/Agent/AgentDBTabViews.swift)) maps directly to that flag: `Active` hides tombstones (the agent's default), `Deleted` only shows tombstones, `All` shows both with the soft-deleted rows dimmed.

There is **no hard-delete tool**. If you need to actually purge a row, do it from the host (the migrator or a developer console) — the model can't.

---

## Tool Reference

All `db_*` tools live in [`Tools/Database/DatabaseTools.swift`](../Packages/OsaurusCore/Tools/Database/DatabaseTools.swift) and delegate to [`LocalAgentBridge`](../Packages/OsaurusCore/Services/AgentBridge/LocalAgentBridge.swift), which serialises mutations per-agent and stamps the `_changelog`. The scheduler tools live in [`Tools/Database/SchedulerTools.swift`](../Packages/OsaurusCore/Tools/Database/SchedulerTools.swift).

### Schema management

| Tool              | Role                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `db_schema`       | Return the full schema snapshot (tables, columns, indexes, saved views).             |
| `db_create_table` | Create a new table with a stated purpose. Host adds the three `_*` system columns.   |
| `db_alter_table`  | Append columns to an existing table.                                                 |
| `db_migrate`      | Run a multi-statement up/down migration the agent authored.                          |

### Row writes

| Tool         | Role                                                                  |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `db_insert`  | Insert one or more rows.                                              |
| `db_upsert`  | Insert-or-update keyed by an explicit conflict column set.            |
| `db_update`  | Update rows matching a typed `where` clause.                          |
| `db_delete`  | **Soft-delete** — stamp `_deleted_at`. Restorable via `db_restore`.   |
| `db_restore` | Clear `_deleted_at` to bring a row back into the live set.            |

### Reads and views

| Tool             | Role                                                                                      |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `db_query`       | Run a read-only SELECT. Rows are capped; a `truncated` flag flips when the limit kicks in. |
| `db_execute`     | Escape-hatch arbitrary write. Restricted by host policy; reach for the typed tools first.  |
| `db_define_view` | Save a parameterised SELECT under a name. Surfaces in the Views tab.                       |
| `db_run_view`    | Execute a saved view with arguments.                                                       |
| `db_list_views`  | Enumerate saved views.                                                                     |
| `db_drop_view`   | Delete a saved view definition.                                                            |

### Scheduling

| Tool                | Role                                                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `schedule_next_run` | Upsert the agent's single next-run slot. See [contract](#schedule_next_run-contract). |
| `cancel_next_run`   | Clear the slot without scheduling a new one.                  |

---

## The Changelog

Every mutation appends a row to a hidden `_changelog` table. Entries carry:

- `actor` — one of `agent`, `user`, `migration`, `system` (`AgentDatabaseActor` in [`AgentDatabase.swift`](../Packages/OsaurusCore/Storage/AgentDatabase.swift)).
- `op` — `insert`, `update`, `soft_delete`, `restore`, `execute`, … (`AgentDatabaseOp`).
- `table`, `row_id`, `at`, plus tool-payload metadata so an audit can reconstruct what changed and why.

The `Activity` tab in the detail view surfaces these alongside `agent_runs` (the scheduler's run history) in a split pane. When a self-scheduled run wakes, [`BackgroundTaskManager`](../Packages/OsaurusCore/Managers/BackgroundTaskManager.swift) seeds `ChatExecutionContext.currentRunId` / `currentRunActor` on the chat session so any `db_*` writes inside that run get stamped against the correct run row.

---

## Storage Quota and Mutation Activity

Each agent declares its own quota via `Agent.settings.limits.storageBytesMax`. Two things consume it:

- **Hard limit.** [`AgentDatabase.enforceStorageQuotaUnlocked()`](../Packages/OsaurusCore/Storage/AgentDatabase.swift) rejects writes once the on-disk file exceeds the limit. The error envelope tells the model what to do (typically delete or migrate older rows).
- **Soft warning.** An edge-triggered `.agentStorageWarn` notification fires when usage crosses a configurable threshold (default ~80%). The UI surfaces this as a banner in the detail view and a system notification that deep-links into the Data tab.

The Data tab also shows a small per-agent **in-flight mutation** badge driven by [`AgentMutationActivity`](../Packages/OsaurusCore/Services/AgentBridge/AgentMutationActivity.swift). The counter is bumped by `LocalAgentBridge.serialized` on every mutation entry/exit, so when an agent run is mid-write you can see the spinner instead of wondering whether the view is stale.

---

## The Self-Scheduling Slot

Schedules in Osaurus follow a deliberately minimal contract: **one row per agent**, in the `agent_next_run` table of `~/.osaurus/scheduler.sqlite` ([`SchedulerDatabase.swift`](../Packages/OsaurusCore/Storage/SchedulerDatabase.swift)).

```
┌─────────────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────────────┐     ┌────────────────────┐
│ agent calls             │ ──▶ │ NextRunScheduler        │ ──▶ │ TaskDispatcher     │
│ schedule_next_run(...)  │     │   - clears slot         │     │   .selfSchedule    │
└─────────────────────────┘     │   - honors pause        │     └────────────────────┘
        ▲                       │   - applies on_miss     │              │
        │                       └─────────────────────────┘              ▼
        │                                                       BackgroundTaskManager
        └────────────────────── agent must re-call ◀─────── runs the chat, stamps
                              schedule_next_run for                agent_runs
                              another wake
```

Writes use SQLite `ON CONFLICT` upsert — **last write wins**. The runtime [`NextRunScheduler`](../Packages/OsaurusCore/Managers/NextRunScheduler.swift) polls the table and, when a slot is due:

1. Clears the row **before** dispatch (so a slow chat run can't double-fire).
2. Checks any active `agent_pause` record.
3. Applies the slot's `on_miss` policy if the slot fell behind while the app was asleep.

Because the slot is cleared on wake, **wakeups are single-shot**. If an agent wants to wake again it has to call `schedule_next_run` from inside the run. This is intentional — it's how the agent expresses "keep me alive" vs. "I'm done".

Every slot carries `NextRunScheduledBy` (`.agent` / `.user` / `.system`) so the audit trail and the Next Run banner can show "scheduled by you" vs. "scheduled by the agent".

---

## `schedule_next_run` Contract

From [`SchedulerTools.swift`](../Packages/OsaurusCore/Tools/Database/SchedulerTools.swift). Pass **either** `scheduled_at` or `in_seconds` (not both).

| Field            | Type            | Required | Meaning                                                                       |
| ---------------- | --------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `scheduled_at`   | ISO-8601 string | one of   | Absolute wake-up time.                                                        |
| `in_seconds`     | integer         | one of   | Relative offset from now.                                                     |
| `instructions`   | string          | yes      | The "wake-up brief" the agent reads when it fires. Becomes the user turn.     |
| `context_views`  | string[]        | no       | Saved-view names to prefetch into the system prompt before the run starts.    |
| `priority`       | `normal` \| `low` | no     | `low` means "skip if the user is mid-conversation when due". Default `normal`. |
| `on_miss`        | `skip` \| `run_once` \| `run_catchup` | no | What to do when the wake-up time has already passed (e.g. laptop was asleep). Default `skip`. |

`cancel_next_run` takes no fields beyond the implicit agent identity.

### Bounds resolution

The requested time is **clamped** against the agent's schedule mode before it's persisted. Bounds are resolved by [`resolveAgentScheduleBounds`](../Packages/OsaurusCore/Tools/Database/SchedulerTools.swift) → [`AgentManager`](../Packages/OsaurusCore/Managers/AgentManager.swift) → the mode preset. If the agent requests "10 days from now" but its mode caps `maxHorizonSeconds` at 24h, the slot is silently clamped to 24h and the tool result carries an `AgentScheduleClampReason` so the model knows why.

---

## Schedule Modes

The four modes from `AgentScheduleMode` in [`Agent.swift`](../Packages/OsaurusCore/Models/Agent/Agent.swift). Each one is a preset over `AgentScheduleSettings`; `AgentScheduleSettings.defaults(for:)` returns the values below.

| Mode      | Max horizon | Min interval | Daily cap | Quiet hours | Days |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------ | --------- | ----------- | ---- |
| Ambient   | 7 days      | 1 hour       | 6         | 22:00–07:00 | All  |
| Reactive  | 24 hours    | 5 minutes    | 48        | None        | All  |
| Project   | 30 days     | 1 hour       | 4         | 22:00–07:00 | All  |
| Manual    | 7 days      | 15 minutes   | **0**     | None        | All  |

**Manual is the off-state.** `dailyRunCap = 0` means [`LocalAgentBridge.scheduleNextRun`](../Packages/OsaurusCore/Services/AgentBridge/LocalAgentBridge.swift) rejects agent-initiated slot writes. The user can still schedule a run manually from the Next Run panel — the rejection is for `schedule_next_run` tool calls, not the UI bridge.

The mode picker lives in the **Configure** tab of the agent detail view ([`AgentsView.swift`](../Packages/OsaurusCore/Views/Agent/AgentsView.swift), `scheduleSection`). Selecting a mode writes both `settings.schedule.mode` and the corresponding preset values via `AgentScheduleSettings.defaults(for:)` — so picking "Reactive" actually rewrites the cap, horizon, quiet-hours, etc., not just the label.

---

## Pause Records

Pauses live in `agent_pause` (also in `scheduler.sqlite`). The row carries just two fields beyond the agent id:

- `paused_until` — absolute resume timestamp.
- `reason` — optional free-text, surfaced under the pause banner.

There is **no `paused_by` column** today. If you need to know whether a pause came from the UI or the agent, look at the reason text (UI paths and tool paths set distinguishable reasons in practice). DB-side audit attribution goes through `_changelog`'s `actor` instead.

The Next Run banner's pause menu maps to these presets:

| Menu item        | Behaviour                                            |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `1 hour`         | `paused_until = now + 1h`                            |
| `4 hours`        | `paused_until = now + 4h`                            |
| `Until tomorrow` | `paused_until` = midnight at the start of the next day |
| `Custom…`        | Opens a sheet for an arbitrary date/time + reason.   |
| `Indefinitely`   | `paused_until = .distantFuture`                      |

All five go through [`LocalAgentBridge.pauseAgent(_:until:reason:)`](../Packages/OsaurusCore/Services/AgentBridge/LocalAgentBridge.swift); `Resume` calls `unpauseAgent`. While a pause is active, [`NextRunScheduler`](../Packages/OsaurusCore/Managers/NextRunScheduler.swift) refuses to dispatch even if a slot is due — the slot stays in the row and fires once the pause expires (subject to its own `on_miss`).

---

## Detail-View Tour

All five DB tabs (and the scheduling chrome that sits above them) live in two files: [`AgentDBTabViews.swift`](../Packages/OsaurusCore/Views/Agent/AgentDBTabViews.swift) and [`NextRunPanelView.swift`](../Packages/OsaurusCore/Views/Agent/NextRunPanelView.swift).

### Next Run banner

Three branches in [`NextRunPanelView`](../Packages/OsaurusCore/Views/Agent/NextRunPanelView.swift):

- **`scheduledRow`** — fires when there's a row in `agent_next_run`. Two-row layout: top row carries the relative time ("in 22h"), absolute timestamp, "by …" badge, the Pause menu, and a read-only **Mode chip**; bottom row carries `Run now` / `Edit` / `Cancel` actions.
- **`pausedBanner`** — fires when an `agent_pause` row is active. Same two-row shape: pause icon + "Paused until X" + reason + Mode chip on top, `Resume` on the bottom.
- **`idleBanner`** — fires when neither is set. Keeps the Pause menu and Mode chip visible so the user always has an entry point.

The Mode chip is read-only and tapping it posts an `.agentDetailDeeplink` notification with `tab: "configure"`, jumping to the Configure tab's Scheduling section.

### Configure → Scheduling

Mode picker rendered as four radio cards (`scheduleModeCard` in [`AgentsView.swift`](../Packages/OsaurusCore/Views/Agent/AgentsView.swift)), each showing the mode name, a one-line tagline, and the resolved preset summary so the user knows what they're switching to before they click. Below the picker are the underlying fields (`maxHorizonSeconds`, `dailyRunCap`, quiet hours, etc.) for power users who want to override the preset.

### Schema / Data / Views / Activity / Home

| Tab        | What it shows                                                                                 |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Schema`   | Read-only catalogue of every table, its columns + types, and indexes. System tables grouped separately. |
| `Data`     | Browse + edit rows. Table dropdown + `Active` / `Deleted` / `All` filter; per-row "Open" affordance; bulk soft-delete via row checkboxes; CSV export. |
| `Views`    | Manage saved views. Split pane: list of view names on the left, definition + live preview on the right. Pin a view to show on `Home`. |
| `Activity` | Split pane of `agent_runs` (left) and the selected run's `_changelog` entries (right). The audit log. |
| `Home`     | Dashboard of pinned views. The agent's "what should I look at right now?" tab.                |

---

## The `.agentDetailDeeplink` Notification

A single `NotificationCenter` channel (`Notification.Name.agentDetailDeeplink` on [`AgentManager`](../Packages/OsaurusCore/Managers/AgentManager.swift)) routes navigation between the detail-view chrome and any view that wants to focus a specific entity. The `userInfo` shape:

| Key         | Type              | Meaning                                                      |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `agentId`   | `UUID` (required) | Which agent to focus.                                        |
| `tab`       | `String`          | `DetailTab` raw value (`configure`, `schema`, `data`, …).    |
| `tableRef`  | `String?`         | Optional table name to pre-select on the Data / Schema tab.  |
| `viewRef`   | `String?`         | Optional view name to pre-select on the Views tab.           |

Posters include the Mode chip in [`NextRunPanelView`](../Packages/OsaurusCore/Views/Agent/NextRunPanelView.swift), the Data-tab "Open" buttons, the Schema-tab "Browse" buttons, and the system notifications fired by [`NotificationService`](../Packages/OsaurusCore/Services/NotificationService.swift). [`AgentsView`](../Packages/OsaurusCore/Views/Agent/AgentsView.swift) is the sole subscriber — it flips `selectedTab` and threads the optional refs through to the focused tab's `initialFocused…` parameter.
