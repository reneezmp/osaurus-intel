//  Lightweight presets used by the create-agent flows (both the in-app
//  AgentEditorSheet and the onboarding "Create your agent" step). Picking
//  one prefills the system prompt and (only when the user hasn't typed yet)
//  a default name. Description, generation overrides, and visual theme are
//  intentionally NOT part of the create flow — they're all editable
//  post-creation in Configure.
