//
//  IntelMemoryConsolidator.swift
//  OsaurusCore (Intel fork)
//
//  Intel equivalent of the excluded `Services/Memory/MemoryConsolidator.swift`
//  (see that file's `exclude:` entry in Package.swift — it sits on disk,
//  reads clean, and is never compiled). That file's only caller lived behind
//  `#if !OSAURUS_INTEL`, so on this fork consolidation has never run: pinned
//  facts and episodes never decay, near-duplicate episodes never merge,
//  nothing gets promoted or evicted, and the transcript grows forever.
//
//  This actor reimplements the same steps against the tables and
//  methods `MemoryDatabase` already ships (decay/evict/prune are storage-
//  layer concerns and were never the missing piece — the orchestration was):
//
//    1. Merge phase (FIRST — owner decision 2026-09-07) — fold near-duplicates
//       in all three stores on one threshold (the "Merge threshold" slider):
//         a. Identity overrides  — safe exact dedup, then word-overlap
//            folding; keeps the longer wording, never merges polarity
//            conflicts (`MemoryDatabase.mergeSimilarIdentityOverrides`).
//         b. Pinned facts        — cosine over each row's stored embedding,
//            word-overlap fallback; keeps the higher-salience copy
//            (`mergePinnedFacts` below).
//         c. Episodes            — cosine over stored embeddings, keeps the
//            older digest (existing step, re-ordered into this phase).
//    2. Salience decay      — `MemoryDatabase.decayPinnedSalience` /
//                             `decayEpisodeSalience`, half-life from
//                             `MemoryConfiguration.salienceHalfLifeDays`.
//    3. Pinned promotion    — facts whose content overlaps (word-shingle
//                             Jaccard) at least `pinnedPromotionThreshold`
//                             recent episodes get a small salience boost.
//    4. Eviction            — pinned facts below `salienceFloor`, idle 30+
//                             days, are deleted via `evictPinnedFacts`.
//    5. Transcript pruning  — episodes and transcript rows older than
//                             `episodeRetentionDays` are removed. A retention
//                             of 0 means "keep forever" (`MemoryConfiguration`'s
//                             own documented semantics, and `pruneEpisodes` /
//                             `pruneTranscript` already treat `days <= 0` as
//                             a no-op at the storage layer) — never treated
//                             as "delete everything."
//
//  Deliberately NOT carried over from the excluded reference:
//    * Vector-store cleanup after prune (`pruneTranscriptReturningKeys` +
//      per-key `MemorySearchService.removeDocument`). That existed because
//      upstream indexes transcript turns in a separate VecturaKit store that
//      SQL deletes don't touch. On Intel there is no separate vector store —
//      `MemorySearchService` (`IntelMemoryConformers.swift`) keeps embeddings
//      as BLOB columns on the same SQLite rows, so `pruneTranscript` alone
//      already removes them. `MemorySearchService.clearIndex()` on this fork
//      is a documented no-op for the same reason.
//    * `MemoryContextAssembler.shared.invalidateCache()` at the end of a
//      pass. `MemoryContextAssembler.swift` is excluded on Intel and
//      `IntelMemoryService.swift` already notes recall has no cache to
//      invalidate here (a known, separately-tracked gap — see
//      docs/MEMORY_PLAN.md).
//    * Episode-merge similarity swapped from upstream's Jaccard/shingle
//      overlap (a stated stopgap in the excluded file: "cosine when
//      embeddings are available is left for a later pass") to real cosine
//      over stored embeddings, per this phase's brief. Pinned-promotion
//      overlap stays Jaccard/shingle, matching the excluded reference —
//      that heuristic doesn't claim to be a cosine threshold and has no
//      stored per-fact vector guarantee to lean on.
