//
//  AgentLoopTools.swift
//  osaurus
//
//  The three tools that drive the unified Chat agent loop:
//
//    - `todo(markdown)`    — write/replace the session's task checklist
//    - `complete(summary)` — finish the task with a one-paragraph summary
//    - `clarify(question)` — pause and wait for the user
//
//  Each has a single required field — smallest schema small local models
//  can reliably call, while remaining expressive enough for frontier ones.
//
//  These are normal `OsaurusTool`s. They execute through `ToolRegistry`
//  like any other tool; the chat layer (`ChatView`'s post-execute branch)
//  then inspects the tool name and result to drive the inline UI: mirror
//  `todo` into `AgentTodoStore`, end the loop on `complete`, pause for
//  input on `clarify`. HTTP-API callers see the raw result strings (no
//  inline UI) — that divergence is intentional and documented.
