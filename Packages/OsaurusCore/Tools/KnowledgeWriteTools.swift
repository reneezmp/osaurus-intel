//
//  `write_knowledge`: create or replace documents in a granted collection,
//  gated by the ordinary tool-permission modal.
//
//  This replaces the curator/proposal/approval architecture. That design
//  asked twice — `propose_knowledge_update` was already `.ask`, and its result
//  was still only a pending draft needing a second approval in the Knowledge
//  tab — and, worse, it returned "pending", so the agent could never confirm
//  what it had actually done. In osaurus#2439 that inability to verify is what
//  drove a model to guess, fabricate progress, and loop for 24 hours. Writing
//  on approval returns a real result the agent can check with
//  `search_knowledge`, which closes the loop.
//
//  Batch-shaped from the start: the task that exposed all this was importing
//  62 documents, and one modal over a reviewable manifest is the difference
//  between a usable flow and 62 approval cards.
