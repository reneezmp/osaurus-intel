//
//  WireTransportProbe.swift
//  osaurus
//
//  Lock-protected sink that captures (a) the scrubbed HTTP request
//  body actually written to the network and (b) the raw inbound
//  bytes BEFORE the Privacy Filter's unscrubber runs. The chat
//  layer consults this after a remote send so Insights can show
//  "this is verbatim what the cloud saw / sent back" — not the
//  pre-scrub local copy.
//
//  Why a class + lock instead of an actor:
//    • URLSession callbacks deliver bytes on background queues
//      that aren't isolated to RemoteProviderService's actor. Using
//      an actor would require an `await` per chunk write, which we
//      explicitly do NOT want on the streaming hot path.
//    • OSAllocatedUnfairLock is used elsewhere in the codebase for
//      the same reason (see `sessionInvalidatedFlag` in
//      RemoteProviderService). Lock-based reads/writes are O(1)
//      and contention is effectively zero (one writer thread at
//      a time on a stream).
//
//  Probe lifecycle:
//    1. ChatEngine (for chatUI sends) creates a probe and sets it
//       on the `WireTransportProbe.current` task-local before calling
//       into the remote service. We avoid threading it through every
//       method signature so future cloud paths (e.g. Anthropic-only
//       extensions) pick it up automatically.
//    2. RemoteProviderService reads `WireTransportProbe.current` at
//       the point where it has `urlRequest.httpBody` (post-scrub
//       canonical JSON) and writes that data into the probe.
//    3. The streaming consumer wraps the inner byte stream and
//       feeds every chunk into the probe BEFORE the unscrubber
//       wrapper runs. That guarantees the captured bytes are
//       exactly what the network delivered.
//    4. ChatEngine reads `wireRequestBody` / `wireResponseBody` off
//       the probe before constructing the `RequestLog`.
//
//  We never write any of the probe state to disk on our own — only
//  InsightsService persists it (and only when the user has opened
//  the chat insights surface, which is gated by app preferences).
