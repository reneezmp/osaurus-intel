//
//  KnowledgeWriteService.swift
//  OsaurusCore — Knowledge
//
//  Applies and reverts mutations to a knowledge collection folder.
//
//  This is the write half of `KnowledgeCurationService.approve` lifted out
//  from behind the proposal queue. The mutation mechanics were never the
//  problem — path confinement, atomic write, incremental re-index — only the
//  queue in front of them was, because a tool that returns "pending" can never
//  tell the calling agent what actually happened (osaurus#2439). Consent moves
//  to the call-time permission modal; this service is what runs once the user
//  allows the call.
//
//  Every mutation records what it replaced in `knowledge_writes` BEFORE
//  touching the file, so a change is revertable even if the process dies
//  mid-write. Reversibility is what makes call-time approval safe: nobody
//  reliably catches fabricated reference material by skimming a diff, but
//  anyone can revert once search starts returning nonsense.
