//
//  KnowledgeWritePreview.swift
//  OsaurusCore — Knowledge
//
//  Turns a pending `write_knowledge` / `delete_knowledge` call into a
//  reviewable manifest, BEFORE it runs.
//
//  This is the load-bearing half of moving knowledge consent to the
//  permission modal. The modal renders `prettyArguments` — a pretty-printed
//  JSON dump — and approving a 29KB document replacement out of a JSON blob
//  is not informed consent. Without a real diff, call-time approval would be
//  strictly worse than the deferred review it replaces, not better.
//
//  Deliberately a pure model with no SwiftUI in it: the manifest is built and
//  tested against synthetic arguments long before any tool emits them, and the
//  view is a dumb renderer over the result.
