// `RollingTokenRate`
//
// Replaces the single-final-average tok/s value the chat UI used to show with
// a steady-state rolling rate that:
//
//   - Skips a warm-up window so first-token latency, reasoning-parser stamp
//     resolution, and per-stream prefill exit don't drag the average down on
//     short responses (the "doesn't ramp up" symptom users reported on
//     thinking-OFF prompts that finish in 100-200 tokens).
//   - Slides over the last N seconds of decode so the visible value reflects
//     CURRENT decode speed, not the cumulative average across the whole
//     generation. Long thinking-mode preambles no longer pull the visible
//     number toward steady-state while content-only short answers no longer
//     get pulled toward setup-cost.
//   - Counts reasoning channel, content channel, and tool-call argument
//     stream tokens uniformly. Vmlx's `info.generationTokenCount` already
//     unifies these on the local-MLX path; this helper enforces the same
//     unification on the remote-provider fallback path so the visible tok/s
//     is computed identically across `local-MLX | remote-API | with-tools |
//     thinking-on/off`.
//
// ## Why a rolling rate (not the full average)
//
// `vmlx`'s `GenerateCompletionInfo.tokensPerSecond` is `generationTokenCount
// / generateTime` — the average over the whole decode loop. For short
// responses, the DECODE is dominated by:
//
//   - first attention pass (one-time per session warmup of MLX kernels)
//   - first reasoning-parser sentinel emission
//   - the final EOS detection + stop-sequence check
//
// On a 50-token answer those costs are 30-50% of wall time. On a 5000-token
// thinking response they are <1%. Same hardware, same model — the AVERAGE
// looks 2× different just from response length. Users perceive this as
// inconsistency between thinking-on and thinking-off because the lengths
// differ by 10×.
//
// A rolling-window rate (last 1-2 seconds OR last 32-64 tokens, whichever
// shorter) reports the steady-state decode rate. Both short and long
// responses converge to the same visible number after warm-up.
//
// ## Window choice
//
// Default: `windowSeconds = 1.5`, `warmupSeconds = 0.4`, `warmupTokens = 4`.
// - 1.5s window: long enough to smooth across the per-token jitter of MLX
//   batched decode (each batch step is ~10-30ms of GPU work), short enough
//   that the displayed value still tracks the user perception of "now"
//   speed.
// - 0.4s warm-up: empirically covers the first-token + first-attention
//   amortisation on M-series. Short enough that even a 30-token answer at
//   60 tok/s sees ~24 tokens reported (skipping ~24 of warm-up amortised).
// - 4-token warm-up: ensures the rate doesn't fire from a single delta on
//   ultra-fast streams where 0.4s would skip the whole answer.
//
// Constants are static-let on the type so callers can override per-test or
// per-platform without re-stamping every call site.
