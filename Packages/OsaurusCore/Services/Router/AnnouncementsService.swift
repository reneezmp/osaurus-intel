//
//  AnnouncementsService.swift
//  osaurus
//
//  Router-served community announcements (launches, events, heads-ups).
//  The router owns copy, artwork, CTAs, and the live window, so nothing
//  about a campaign is hard-coded in the app or needs a release to change.
//
//  Contract (see docs/osaurus-integration.md in osaurus-router):
//  - `GET /announcements?app_version=…` is unauthenticated, IP rate-limited,
//    and returns only what is live right now by the router's clock. The
//    client never re-evaluates the schedule locally.
//  - `slug` is the dismissal key: `ai.osaurus.announcement.<slug>.seen`.
//  - The router counts each feed response that includes an announcement as
//    a "delivery", so fetches stay on the natural triggers (launch and
//    foreground activation) — never a timer. On top of the contract this
//    service throttles activation fetches to once per 30 minutes so a user
//    Cmd-Tabbing all day is not a stream of requests.
//  - Failures of any kind mean "no announcements": never block launch and
//    never surface an error.
//
//  This type owns fetching, throttling, eligibility and the persisted seen
//  flags; presentation and the "don't stack" deferrals live in
//  `AppDelegate.presentAnnouncementIfEligible()`.
//
//  Intel: these are **upstream's** announcements, written for upstream
//  Osaurus on Apple Silicon. Intel shows them labelled as such, with a
//  warning that what they promote may not exist in this build
//  (`AnnouncementDialogContent`), drops `osaurus://` deep links (they target
//  upstream app screens), sends no `app_version` (Intel's 1.x numbers would
//  read as a future upstream build to the router's version bounds), and
//  lets the user turn the feed off for good (`optOut()`).
