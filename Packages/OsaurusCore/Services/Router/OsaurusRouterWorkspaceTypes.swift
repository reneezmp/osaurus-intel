//  Wire types for the router's Osaurus Workspaces API (`/workspaces/*`). A workspace is an
//  owner's group whose members join through invite links and share relay
//  agents. There is one plan: every workspace is paid per workspace (monthly
//  or yearly) on the owner's single Stripe subscription — an owner's first
//  subscription starts with a trial — and spends from a shared monthly credit
//  pool. A workspace whose owner subscription (or admin comp) lapsed is
//  `suspended` until the owner reactivates it. Identity is the wallet; the
//  router's `osaurus_id` decoration (the claimed `@handle`) is shown when
//  present, and the optional `dino_id` decoration is not consumed. Money is
//  micro-USD strings exactly like the personal `/credits/*` API. Loosely
//  specified/expandable response fields decode as optionals so newer router
//  deployments never break older clients.
