//  ResolvedToolset.swift
//  osaurus
//
//  Bundle of every tool-axis decision the composer makes for a single
//  request: which tools landed in the schema, which always-loaded names made
//  it through the freeze filter, the frozen enabled-capabilities manifest,
//  plus the context-window auto-disable verdict (kept here because the
//  size-class flag drives both `effectiveToolsOff` and the final
//  `ComposedContext.contextDisable`).
//
//  Replaces the previous "thread 8 named values down through helpers"
//  pattern. Once `resolveToolset` returns one of these, every downstream
//  gate consumes one struct instead of a fan-out parameter list.
//
