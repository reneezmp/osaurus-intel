//  The per-task state machine the harness holds so the model doesn't have to.
//
//  Diagnosis (see docs/AGENT_LOOP.md): a 1B-active model used as both planner
//  and executor in a free, stateless loop has to reconstruct from raw tool
//  text — every turn — where it is, what it just received, and what the next
//  valid move is. That reconstruction is the work it fails at. This type moves
//  that bookkeeping into the loop: it classifies each tool result, tracks what
//  the last result implies, dedupes back-to-back identical re-issues, and
//  emits a (non-load-bearing) next-step nudge. The structured result objects
//  (`ToolEnvelope.listing`, `kind: "file"`) are what actually carry the win —
//  this layer is a thin nudge on top, validated to not be load-bearing.
//
//  One instance per loop run. `ChatSession` keeps a session-scoped instance so
//  a listing survives across user messages; the HTTP `/agents/{id}/run` and
//  plugin loops are stateless across requests by design, so they use a
//  per-request / per-invocation instance (nothing to survive).
