//
//  Phase 3 — Self-scheduling dispatch loop (spec §9). Owns the runtime
//  side of the agent's next-run slot: read `agent_next_run`, sleep until
//  the soonest scheduled row, then dispatch through `TaskDispatcher`
//  with `SessionSource.selfSchedule`.
//
//  Concurrency model:
//
//   - One timer task (`tickerTask`) at any time. It sleeps until either
//     the next scheduled row or a 60-second fallback (whichever fires
//     first), then re-reads from `SchedulerDatabase` and dispatches due
//     rows. The 60-second fallback is the safety net for "a row was
//     added while we were sleeping" — `notifyRowChanged()` cancels the
//     sleep early when that happens at runtime.
//   - Bounded concurrency: at most `Self.maxConcurrent` (4) due rows
//     dispatched per tick. Anything beyond that waits for the next tick.
//   - On-miss policy (`NextRunOnMiss`) is applied at dispatch time for
//     each row, so a cold start sees `runOnce`/`skip`/`runCatchup`
//     behavior consistent with the wake-time evaluation.
//
//  This manager is fully separate from `ScheduleManager` (recurring
//  user-authored schedules). `ScheduleManager.executeSchedule` dispatches
//  with `source: .schedule`; `NextRunScheduler` uses `.selfSchedule`.
