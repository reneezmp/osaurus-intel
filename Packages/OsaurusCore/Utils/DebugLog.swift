//  Lightweight file-based debug logger.  Works from any isolation context.
//  Writes timestamped lines to /tmp/osaurus_debug.log.
//  No-ops in production (only active when the file already exists or is created
//  on first write).

/// (cheap) line formatting on their own thread; the `open`/`seek`/`write`/`close`

/// `debugLog`. A serial queue also preserves append ordering across concurrent
/// callers without a lock.
