//  StreamingDeltaProcessor.swift
//  osaurus
//
//  Streaming delta processing pipeline used by ChatView. Handles delta
//  buffering and per-frame UI sync.
//
//  Reasoning routing is owned by the engine layer:
//    - Local MLX models: vmlx-swift's `BatchEngine.generate` emits
//      `Generation.reasoning(String)` deltas on a dedicated channel.
//      `GenerationEventMapper` translates each one to
//      `ModelRuntimeEvent.reasoning(_:)`, which `streamWithTools`
//      encodes as a `StreamingReasoningHint` sentinel.
//    - Remote providers: `RemoteProviderService` emits
//      `StreamingReasoningHint.encode(_:)` for streamed `reasoning_content`.
//  ChatView decodes the sentinel and forwards the text to
//  `receiveReasoning(_:)`, which appends to the Think panel.
//
//  Intel (smooth streaming, `W-chat-ux`): upstream's file, with
//  - a plain `deinit` instead of `isolated deinit`, which needs a newer
//    runtime than macOS 13; the timers and waiters it releases are
//    `nonisolated(unsafe)` so the deinit may touch them;
//  - `finalize(immediately:)`: a stopped run drains at once instead of
//    typing out the tail.
