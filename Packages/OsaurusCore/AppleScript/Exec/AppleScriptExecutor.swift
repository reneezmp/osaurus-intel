//
//  AppleScriptExecutor.swift
//  OsaurusCore — AppleScript Computer Use
//
//  In-process `NSAppleScript` execution with a hard timeout watchdog. Running
//  the script in-process (rather than shelling out to `osascript`) is
//  deliberate: macOS attributes the resulting Automation / Apple Events
//  permission prompts to "Osaurus", so the first `tell application …` triggers
//  the OS consent dialog for THIS app and subsequent runs are governed by the
//  user's choice in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Automation. This
//  mirrors the existing in-process probes in `SystemPermissionService`.
//
//  `executeAndReturnError` is synchronous and can block (a long script, an app
//  that never replies, or a modal the script spawned), so every run is
//  dispatched onto a process-wide SERIAL queue (the scripting component is not
//  concurrency-safe — see `executionQueue`) and raced against a timeout. On
//  timeout the in-flight run is abandoned (we cannot safely interrupt a thread
//  mid-Apple-Event) and the caller is resumed with `.timedOut`; a run still
//  queued when its caller times out is skipped. The continuation is resumed
//  exactly once.
//
//  Every in-flight script also arms a main-runloop HEARTBEAT timer (see
//  `beginMainRunLoopHeartbeat`): AppleScript's Apple-event reply delivery and
//  post-send main-actor scheduling both depend on the MAIN run loop turning,
//  which a headless CLI parked in `CFRunLoopRun` does not do on its own.
//  Without it, sends from background threads stall for tens of seconds (or
//  forever) and the process's main actor wedges — observed live as eval-suite
//  watchdog kills attributed to "TCC consent" that were really a sleeping
//  run loop.
//
//  Per the model-runtime non-negotiables: this reports the REAL outcome
//  (success output, compile error, runtime error, or the -1743 "automation not
//  permitted" status) back to the model. There is no output coercion or fake
//  success — a failing script returns its actual error so the model can correct.
//
//  JXA (JavaScript for Automation) runs through the same serial queue and
//  watchdog via OSAKit's `OSAScript` with the JavaScript OSA component —
//  identical outcome mapping, different language runtime.
//
