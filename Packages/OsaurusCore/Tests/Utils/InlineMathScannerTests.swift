//  InlineMathScannerTests.swift
//
//  Pin the inline-math delimiter rules.
//
//  The reported defect: `$O(n)$` rendered as literal text while `\(O(n \log n)\)`
//  rendered as real math *in the same table cell*, because a span only counted as
//  math when it contained `\`, `^`, `_` or `{`. `O(n)` contains none of them, so
//  the most common inline form models emit showed its raw delimiters.
//
//  Loosening that rule is only safe if the scanner still turns down the two things
//  `$` is otherwise used for — currency amounts and shell variables inside code
//  spans — so those negatives are pinned here just as hard as the positives.
