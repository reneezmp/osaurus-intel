//  KnowledgeWriteServiceRoundTripTests.swift
//  OsaurusCoreTests — Knowledge
//
//  End-to-end: write / delete / revert against a real collection folder, a
//  real write log, and a real index.
//
//  Everything else in this feature is tested one layer up (argument parsing,
//  the preview manifest, log queries) — all of which passed while a type
//  mismatch in `delete_knowledge`'s execute loop reached a build. These tests
//  exercise the layer that actually moves bytes on disk, so a regression in
//  the mutation or the undo shows up as a failing test rather than as a
//  collection nobody can restore.
//
//  Runs under `OsaurusPaths.overrideRoot` so `.shared` databases open inside a
//  temp directory: the write log, the index, and the collection store are all
//  the production singletons, just pointed somewhere disposable.
