//
//  The durable write log behind knowledge direct write. Call-time approval
//  trades considered review for immediate action, and revert is what makes
//  that trade safe, so the log's guarantees are the load-bearing part:
//  a record survives the chat that made it, it carries enough to restore the
//  prior document exactly, and reverting can never quietly discard content
//  that arrived after the agent's write.
