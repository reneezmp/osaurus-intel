//
//  `edit_knowledge` exists because whole-document replacement cannot edit a
//  large document at all.
//
//  A 14.5KB file is already around a small local model's output token cap, so
//  asking it to restate the document to change one repeated phrase does not
//  merely run slowly — it truncates, and the truncated text then REPLACES the
//  original. Observed live: a 120 section catalogue came back with 6 sections
//  and the other 114 were destroyed, reported as a routine "1 replaced".
//
//  These tests pin the substitution semantics. The safety properties around
//  them (approval card, write log, revert) are inherited from the write path
//  and covered there.
