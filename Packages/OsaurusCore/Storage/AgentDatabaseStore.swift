//  AgentDatabaseStore.swift
//  osaurus
//
//  Lifecycle registry for `AgentDatabase` instances. Each agent that
//  has opted in to the Agent DB feature (spec §5.5) gets one
//  connection here, opened lazily on first access and held until the
//  agent is deleted or the host shuts down.
//
//  The store is intentionally minimal — it owns the map, not the
//  policy. Policy (when a connection is opened, who's allowed to
//  write, what the actor is) lives in `LocalAgentBridge`.
