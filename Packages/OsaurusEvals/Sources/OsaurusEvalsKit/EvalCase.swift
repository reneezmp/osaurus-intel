//  JSON schema for a single behaviour case. Cases live as small JSON
//  files under `Suites/<domain>/` so non-Swift contributors can add new
//  ones with a text editor. Schema design:
//    - `domain` is the eval family (e.g. "capability_search",
//      "capability_claims", "schema"). It selects which runner
//      code-path executes the case.
//    - `fixtures` describes the world the case should run against
//      (required plugins, seeded methods, enabled skills/tools). The
//      runner uses `requirePlugins` to skip cases the local install
//      can't satisfy instead of failing them — a contributor without
//      `osaurus.browser` should still be able to run the rest of the suite.
//    - `expect` is what we'd score against. All matchers are optional
//      so a case can scope to just the components it cares about.
